				"title": "Software Development Using Generative AI",
				"content_html": "<p>Recently, I had a conversation with someone about software development using\nChatGPT, and a few things caught my attention. I decided to summarize my\nthoughts here. 🪄</p>\n<p>最近ChatGPTを使ったソフトウェア開発について人と話したときに気になったことがあるので、思った事まとめておこうと思います。</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<h2 id=\"dramatic-cost-reduction\">Dramatic Cost Reduction</h2>\n<p>The use of generative AI has dramatically reduced the costs of producing images\nand music. For example, tasks like illustration creation (using services like\nMidjourney and DALL-E 2) and music creation (using services like Udio and Suno),\nwhich previously required specialists, can now be done by individuals in about\nfive minutes using generative AI-powered services.</p>\n<p>In software development, the use of generative AI for development support is\nalso spreading. Many developers are likely using tools like Github Copilot.</p>\n<p>However, applications of generative AI in software development are progressing\nbeyond mere coding support. For example, I recently changed the static site\ngenerator for my main blog, which required converting the metadata of several\nhundred articles. I wrote a conversion program in Python, but by providing\nChatGPT with the prerequisites and requirements, I only needed to make about 10%\nmodifications to the generated code.</p>\n<p>This example shows that generative AI can shoulder not only development support\nbut also the creation of software itself, similar to image and music\nproduction. In the example above, what would have taken about two weeks if\noutsourced to a development vendor was reduced to about 30 minutes of work\nusing generative AI.</p>\n<p>The cost is only 0.6%.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-generative-ai-software-development-brings\">What Generative AI Software Development Brings</h2>\n<p>The rationale for traditional software development was that it could reduce the\nworkload of many people through repeated use. Therefore, single-use software\ndevelopment for specific users was not permitted.</p>\n<p>However, there is a world where single-use software development has been\nallowed: the realm of data science. This is because of the unique nature of\ndatasets and the need for trial and error, where speed is prioritized over\nreuse. The most significant reason is that the benefits gained from single-use\nsoftware development outweigh the costs.</p>\n<p>By leveraging generative AI, it becomes possible to reduce costs in general\nsoftware development similarly. This means that even single-use software\ndevelopment for one user, which does not contribute to reducing the workload of\nmany, becomes feasible.</p>\n<p>In other words, we are entering an era where problems that could be solved by\nsoftware but were left unaddressed due to development costs can now be resolved\nquickly using generative AI for software development.</p>\n<p>In practice, when you ask ChatGPT a question like &ldquo;What is the date 100 days\nafter August 9, 2024?&rdquo;, the following single-use Python code, specialized for\nthis problem, is generated and executed behind the scenes:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4\"><code class=\"language-python\" data-lang=\"python\"><span style=\"color:#f92672\">from</span> datetime <span style=\"color:#f92672\">import</span> datetime, timedelta\n\n<span style=\"color:#75715e\"># Starting date</span>\nstart_date <span style=\"color:#f92672\">=</span> datetime(<span style=\"color:#ae81ff\">2024</span>, <span style=\"color:#ae81ff\">8</span>, <span style=\"color:#ae81ff\">8</span>)\n\n<span style=\"color:#75715e\"># Calculate the date 100 days later</span>\nend_date <span style=\"color:#f92672\">=</span> start_date <span style=\"color:#f92672\">+</span> timedelta(days<span style=\"color:#f92672\">=</span><span style=\"color:#ae81ff\">100</span>)\nend_date<span style=\"color:#f92672\">.</span>strftime(<span style=\"color:#e6db74\">&#39;%Y-%m-</span><span style=\"color:#e6db74\">%d</span><span style=\"color:#e6db74\">&#39;</span>)\n</code></pre></div><h2 id=\"differences-from-rpa-and-no-code\">Differences from RPA and No-Code</h2>\n<p>Similar technologies include RPA and no-code solutions. Many companies have\nadopted these technologies, riding the wave of the DX trend.</p>\n<p>Both have the effect of lowering software development costs, but there are\nsignificant differences in their technology and implementation effects.</p>\n<p>From a technical perspective, while generative AI software development involves\ncustom development by AI according to requirements, RPA and no-code solutions\nappear to meet user requests but, in reality, only pour parameters into\npre-made software provided by vendors. Therefore, what can be achieved must be\nbased on the templates of the pre-made software.</p>\n<p>More importantly than these technical differences is the impact of their\nimplementation. In many cases with RPA and no-code solutions, user departments,\nfrustrated with waiting in line for the development department&rsquo;s backlog,\ndevelop the software themselves. This means that non-developers are creating\nreusable software, or corporate software assets, which is a nightmare. Years\nlater, the software will likely become a maintenance burden due to the users'\ntransfer or the vendors' product lifecycle.</p>\n<p>In contrast, single-use software development using generative AI emphasizes the\noutcomes rather than the software itself. Thus, the specifics of the software\ndo not matter.

				"content_text": "Recently, I had a conversation with someone about software development using\nChatGPT, and a few things caught my attention. I decided to summarize my\nthoughts here. 🪄\n\n最近ChatGPTを使ったソフトウェア開発について人と話したときに気になったことがあるので、思った事まとめておこうと思います。\n<!--toc-->\n<!--more-->\n\n## Dramatic Cost Reduction\n\nThe use of generative AI has dramatically reduced the costs of producing images\nand music. For example, tasks like illustration creation (using services like\nMidjourney and DALL-E 2) and music creation (using services like Udio and Suno),\nwhich previously required specialists, can now be done by individuals in about\nfive minutes using generative AI-powered services.\n\nIn software development, the use of generative AI for development support is\nalso spreading. Many developers are likely using tools like Github Copilot.\n\nHowever, applications of generative AI in software development are progressing\nbeyond mere coding support. For example, I recently changed the static site\ngenerator for my main blog, which required converting the metadata of several\nhundred articles. I wrote a conversion program in Python, but by providing\nChatGPT with the prerequisites and requirements, I only needed to make about 10%\nmodifications to the generated code.\n\nThis example shows that generative AI can shoulder not only development support\nbut also the creation of software itself, similar to image and music\nproduction. In the example above, what would have taken about two weeks if\noutsourced to a development vendor was reduced to about 30 minutes of work\nusing generative AI.\n\nThe cost is only 0.6%.\n\n## What Generative AI Software Development Brings\n\nThe rationale for traditional software development was that it could reduce the\nworkload of many people through repeated use. Therefore, single-use software\ndevelopment for specific users was not permitted.\n\nHowever, there is a world where single-use software development has been\nallowed: the realm of data science. This is because of the unique nature of\ndatasets and the need for trial and error, where speed is prioritized over\nreuse. The most significant reason is that the benefits gained from single-use\nsoftware development outweigh the costs.\n\nBy leveraging generative AI, it becomes possible to reduce costs in general\nsoftware development similarly. This means that even single-use software\ndevelopment for one user, which does not contribute to reducing the workload of\nmany, becomes feasible.\n\nIn other words, we are entering an era where problems that could be solved by\nsoftware but were left unaddressed due to development costs can now be resolved\nquickly using generative AI for software development.\n\nIn practice, when you ask ChatGPT a question like \"What is the date 100 days\nafter August 9, 2024?\", the following single-use Python code, specialized for\nthis problem, is generated and executed behind the scenes:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\n# Starting date\nstart_date = datetime(2024, 8, 8)\n\n# Calculate the date 100 days later\nend_date = start_date + timedelta(days=100)\nend_date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')\n```\n\n## Differences from RPA and No-Code\n\nSimilar technologies include RPA and no-code solutions. Many companies have\nadopted these technologies, riding the wave of the DX trend.\n\nBoth have the effect of lowering software development costs, but there are\nsignificant differences in their technology and implementation effects.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, while generative AI software development involves\ncustom development by AI according to requirements, RPA and no-code solutions\nappear to meet user requests but, in reality, only pour parameters into\npre-made software provided by vendors. Therefore, what can be achieved must be\nbased on the templates of the pre-made software.\n\nMore importantly than these technical differences is the impact of their\nimplementation. In many cases with RPA and no-code solutions, user departments,\nfrustrated with waiting in line for the development department's backlog,\ndevelop the software themselves. This means that non-developers are creating\nreusable software, or corporate software assets, which is a nightmare. Years\nlater, the software will likely become a maintenance burden due to the users'\ntransfer or the vendors' product lifecycle.\n\nIn contrast, single-use software development using generative AI emphasizes the\noutcomes rather than the software itself. Thus, the specifics of the software\ndo not matter. Even so, a verifiable artifact in the form of \"source code\" is\ncreated, making it a completely transparent process (white box).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nSeeing companies that claim to have achieved \"DX\" by introducing RPA and\nno-code solutions gives me chills. In contrast, companies should recognize the\nnew application methods of software development, where generative AI can be\nused to solve problems on the spot, similar to the approach taken by data\nscientists.\n\nIn such a world, engineers with the ability to read source code will become\nincreasingly necessary. Companies currently investing in RPA and no-code\nsolutions should be cautious, as they may be going against the trend.\n\n---\n\n## 劇的なコスト削減\n\n生成系AIの活用により、画像や音楽の制作コストが劇的に削減されています。例えば、\nこれまで専門家に依頼しなければならなかったイラスト作成（MidjourneyやDALL-E 2な\nど）や音楽作成（UdioやSunoなど）を、生成系AIを取り入れたサービスを使うことで、\n自分で5分ほどで望みの画像や音楽を制作することができます。\n\nソフトウェア開発においても、生成系AIを活用した開発支援が広がってきています。実\n際に、Github Copilotのようなツールを使用している開発者も多いでしょう。\n\nしかし、これらのコーディング支援とは別の次元で、ソフトウェア開発への応用も進ん\nでいます。例えば、最近私はメインブログの静的サイトジェネレータを変更しました\nが、それに伴い記事のメタデータの変換が必要でした。数百ある記事の変換プログラム\nをPythonで書きましたが、ChatGPTに前提と要件を伝えて生成されたコードをベースに、\n10%程度の修正を行うだけで済みました。\n\nこれは、開発作業の支援だけでなく、画像や音楽の制作と同様にソフトウェア制作その\nものを生成系AIに肩代わりさせることができる例です。上記の例では、開発ベンダーに\n依頼すると2週間ほどの時間がかかるところを、生成系AIを使って自分でコードを作成す\nれば30分程度で済みます。\n\nコストは0.6%で済んでしまいます。\n\n## 生成系AIによるソフトウェア開発がもたらすもの\n\n従来のソフトウェア開発のRationale（根拠）は、何度も使用されることで多くの人の作\n業を軽減できることにありました。そのため、特定のユーザーのための使い切りのソフ\nトウェア開発は許されませんでした。\n\nしかし、使い切りのソフトウェア開発が許されてきた世界があります。それはデータサ\nイエンスの領域です。これは、データセットの特異性やそれに伴う試行錯誤の必要性、\n再利用より迅速性が重視されたためです。最も大きな理由は、使い切りのソフトウェア\n開発のコストに対して得られる成果が大きいからです。\n\n生成系AIを活用すれば、一般的なソフトウェア開発でも同様にコスト削減が可能とな\nり、多くの人の作業軽減に貢献しない、一人のユーザーのためだけの使い切りのソフト\nウェア開発を行うことも可能になります。\n\nつまり、これまで開発コストを理由にソフトウェアで解決出来る問題が放置されていた\n状況を「生成系AI使って、ささっとソフトウェア開発をして解決すればよい」という時\n代になってきていると感じます。\n\n実際、ChatGPTで「2024年8月9日の100日後は何日？」というような質問の回答を作るの\nに、裏では以下のようはこの問題に特化した使い切りのPythonコードが生成されて実行\nされています。\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\n# Starting date\nstart_date = datetime(2024, 8, 8)\n\n# Calculate the date 100 days later\nend_date = start_date + timedelta(days=100)\nend_date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')\n```\n\n## RPAやノーコードとの違い\n\n似たような技術にはRPAやノーコードがあります。DXの流行に乗って、これらを導入した\n企業も多いと思います。\n\nどちらもソフトウェア開発コストを下げるという効果がありますが、その技術と導入効\n果の面で大きな違いがあります。\n\n技術面で見ると、生成系AIによるソフトウェア開発では要件に従いAIよるソフトウェア\nのカスタム開発が行われていますが、RPAやノーコードではユーザーのリクエストに沿っ\nて必要なソフトウェアを実現しているように見えますが、実際にはベンダーが用意した\nソフトウェアにパラメータを流し込んでいるだけです。そのため、実現できることもあ\nらかじめ用意されたソフトウェアのひな形に沿った要件に落とし込む必要があります。\n\nこういった技術的な違いよりも、問題はその導入効果です。\nRPAやノーコードで多く行われているのは、開発部門のバックログの列に並ぶことに業を\n煮やしたユーザー部門が自身で開発を行うというパターンです。これは使い回すソフト\nウェア、つまり企業のソフトウェア資産を開発者でない素人が開発してしまうことを意\n味します。悪夢でしかありません。数年後には開発したユーザーの異動やベンダーの製\n品ライフサイクルから、メンテナンスできないソフトウェアという負の遺産になってい\nることでしょう[^1]。\n\n一方、生成系AIによる使い切りソフトウェア開発は、生成したソフトウェアそのもので\nはなく、その成果が重視されるため、どのようなソフトウェアだったかは問題になりま\nせん。それでも、「ソースコード」という検証可能な成果物が作成されるため、完全に\n透明な状態（ホワイトボックス）です。\n\n[^1]: 「サーバー型RPAならば集中管理できてそうはならない」という意見もありますが、ならばIT部門が開発して管理すればよくベンダー依存のランタイム上でシステムを構築する意味はないのではないでしょうか？ もっともここにAIを応用すると世界が変わる可能性はありますが、現時点ではまだ予測不能です。\n\n## まとめ\n\n\nRPAやノーコードのソリューションを導入して「DX実現」としている企業の将来を思うと\n暗い未来しか想像できません。\n\n一方で従来のソフトウェア開発とは異なる、これまでデータサイエンティストが取り組\nんできたようなアプローチ、つまるソフトウェア開発によるその場の問題解決が生成系\nAIを使うと可能になるので、新しいソフトウェアの応用方法として企業はしっかりと認\n知すべきだと思います。\n\nこういった世界ではソースコードを読む能力を持ったエンジニアはますます必要になっ\nてくるので、そういった意味でもRPAやノーコードに取り組んでいる企業は逆流している\nので気をつけたほうがよいと思います。\n\n",
