The photographs have dates printed on them, and I've been manually setting these dates in the EXIF information using ExifTool.\n\n\nI use Hazel to organize image files, and I've already created a tool that updates file creation dates that Hazel can read with the shooting dates from EXIF data.

				"content_text": "最近営業日の告知をInstgramやfacebookにしか掲載しないお店があるが、一体どういうつもりなんだろう。Instagramを使っていない客がいるとか想像できないのだろうか？\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\n### 1. なぜ店舗はSNSのみで情報発信するのか\r\n\r\n店舗がSNSでのみ情報発信することについて、考えられる理由と問題点を分析してみましょう。\r\n\r\n- **運営効率** - SNSでの投稿は迅速で簡単です。ウェブサイトやその他の通信チャネルの管理と比較すると、よりコスト効率が良いです。\r\n- **ターゲット層の認識の誤り** - お店が主に若い世代をターゲットにしている場合、SNSでの発信で十分だと考えているかもしれません。しかし、これは若い世代でさえも問題のある仮定です。\r\n- **リソースの制限** - 小規模ビジネスでは、複数の通信チャネルを管理する人員や時間が不足している可能性があります。\r\n\r\nしかし、もっとも大きな理由は店舗スタッフの**ITリテラシーの低さ**が理由でしょう。\r\n\r\n- どこで発信すると、誰に届くか理解していない\r\n- WordPressなどのサイト運営する能力がなく、SNSのようにプライベートの延長で他者のプラットフォームに依存した情報発信しかできない\r\n\r\n\r\n以前は多くのSNSがユーザー以外にもオープンでしたが、TwitterやFacebook、Instagramを見ればわかるようにコンテンツ閲覧にはユーザー登録を要求するSNSが多くなってきたため、SNSで発信する情報がSNS外のユーザーに届かないということがより顕著になってきました。\r\n\r\n\r\n### 2. SNSプラットフォーム依存のリスク\r\n\r\n店舗情報発信でのSNS利用は非常に手軽ですが、次のようなリスクもあります。\r\n\r\n- 高齢者やプライバシーを重視しSNSを利用しない賢者、特定のSNSを利用していない顧客など潜在的な顧客に情報が届かず、ビジネスチャンスを逃している可能性があります。\r\n- SNS外で情報が見えないため、検索エンジンの視認性が欠如し、ニーズを持った潜在的な顧客を逃す可能性があります。\r\n- SNSでは投稿の表示のアルゴリズムをプラットフォーマーが握っているため、店舗で管理できません。このため有利に働くことも有れば、必要な顧客層の情報が届かないリスクもあります。\r\n- プラットフォームのサービス終了、アカウント停止など、店舗の情報発信が不能となるリスクが常に有ります。\r\n- 自社サイトを持たないことによりブランディングやビジネスイメージの確立が困難となるリスクがあります。\r\n\r\n\r\n### まとめ\r\n\r\n\r\n以前は自社サイトを持ちつつSNSでも情報発信するスタイルが一般的でしたが、昨今はSNSでの情報発信を重視しすぎる店舗が増えたように感じます。\r\n\r\n効果的な情報発信戦略としては、以下のようなマルチチャネルアプローチが望ましいでしょう：\r\n\r\n\r\n1. **基本的な情報発信プラットフォーム**\r\n   - 自社ウェブサイト（基本情報、営業時間、アクセス）\r\n   - 店頭での掲示\r\n   - Googleビジネスプロフィール\r\n\r\n\r\n2. **補完的な情報発信チャネル**\r\n   - SNS（Instagram、Facebook等）\r\n   - メールマガジン\r\n\r\nこのように複数のチャネルを組み合わせることで、より幅広い顧客層にリーチでき、プラットフォーム依存のリスクも軽減できます。重要なのは、それぞれのチャネルの特性を理解し、効果的に活用することです。\r\n\r\nどうでもいいけど、近くのパン屋の営業時間くらい、SNSに登録しなくてもわかるようにしてほしい！\n",

id=\"logseqとは何かシンプルな説明\">LogSeqとは何か、シンプルな説明</h4>\n<p>LogSeqは、あなたの考えやアイデア、メモを自由に書き留め、それらをつなぎ合わせることができるデジタルノートアプリです。紙のノートとは違い、書いた内容を後から簡単に整理したり、関連する情報どうしをリンクでつなげたりすることができます。</p>\n<p>特徴的なのは、以下の3つのポイントです：</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>箇条書きベースで書ける</p>\n<ul>\n<li>考えたことを思いつくままメモできる</li>\n<li>後から簡単に整理できる</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>日付ごとにページが自動で作られる</p>\n<ul>\n<li>日記のように、その日のことを記録できる</li>\n<li>カレンダーのように過去の記録を見返せる</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>ページ同士をつなげられる</p>\n<ul>\n<li>関連する情報どうしを簡単にリンクできる</li>\n<li>新しい気づきや発見を見つけやすい</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h4 id=\"なぜlogseqが便利なのか\">なぜLogSeqが便利なのか</h4>\n<p>LogSeqが便利な理由は、私たちの脳の働き方に合わせた設計にあります：</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>思考の自然な流れを妨げない</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>思いついたことを、その場でさっと書き留められる</li>\n<li>後でどこに書いたか探すことを気にせずに、まずメモできる</li>\n<li>整理は後からでもできる</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>情報同士のつながりを自然に作れる</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>関連する情報を<code>[[リンク]]</code>で簡単につなげられる</li>\n<li>一度つないだ情報は、双方向から見つけられる</li>\n<li>気づかなかった情報のつながりが自然と見えてくる</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>記憶と振り返りをサポート</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>日付ごとのページが自動で作られるので、いつ何を考えたかが残る</li>\n<li>過去の記録が自然とタイムライン化される</li>\n<li>定期的な振り返りが簡単にできる</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>知識が育っていく</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>書いた内容は単なる記録として終わらない</li>\n<li>新しい情報を追加するたびに、既存の知識とつながっていく</li>\n<li>それによって新しい発見や気づきが生まれる</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>つまり、LogSeqは「とりあえずメモ」から始めて、そこから自然と「つながりのある知識」を育てていけるツールなのです。</p>\n<h3

考えたことを思いつくままメモできる\r\n   - 後から簡単に整理できる\r\n\r\n\r\n2. 日付ごとにページが自動で作られる\r\n\r\n\r\n   - 日記のように、その日のことを記録できる\r\n   - カレンダーのように過去の記録を見返せる\r\n\r\n\r\n3. ページ同士をつなげられる\r\n   - 関連する情報どうしを簡単にリンクできる\r\n   - 新しい気づきや発見を見つけやすい\r\n\r\n\r\n#### なぜLogSeqが便利なのか\r\n\r\n\r\nLogSeqが便利な理由は、私たちの脳の働き方に合わせた設計にあります：\r\n\r\n\r\n1. **思考の自然な流れを妨げない**\r\n\r\n\r\n   - 思いついたことを、その場でさっと書き留められる\r\n   - 後でどこに書いたか探すことを気にせずに、まずメモできる\r\n   - 整理は後からでもできる\r\n\r\n\r\n2. **情報同士のつながりを自然に作れる**\r\n\r\n\r\n   - 関連する情報を`[[リンク]]`で簡単につなげられる\r\n   - 一度つないだ情報は、双方向から見つけられる\r\n   - 気づかなかった情報のつながりが自然と見えてくる\r\n\r\n\r\n3. **記憶と振り返りをサポート**\r\n\r\n\r\n   - 日付ごとのページが自動で作られるので、いつ何を考えたかが残る\r\n   - 過去の記録が自然とタイムライン化される\r\n   - 定期的な振り返りが簡単にできる\r\n\r\n\r\n4. **知識が育っていく**\r\n   - 書いた内容は単なる記録として終わらない\r\n   - 新しい情報を追加するたびに、既存の知識とつながっていく\r\n   - それによって新しい発見や気づきが生まれる\r\n\r\n\r\nつまり、LogSeqは「とりあえずメモ」から始めて、そこから自然と「つながりのある知識」を育てていけるツールなのです。\r\n\r\n\r\n### LogSeqの基本的な使い方\r\n\r\n\r\n#### 最初の画面の見方\r\n\r\n\r\nLogSeqを開くと、シンプルな画面が表示されます。画面の構成を理解しましょう：\r\n\r\n\r\n- **左側のサイドバー**\r\n\r\n\r\n  - ジャーナル（日付ごとのページ）へのリンク\r\n  - お気に入りページの一覧\r\n  - 全てのページ一覧\r\n\r\n\r\n- **メイン画面**\r\n\r\n\r\n  - 現在の日付のページが自動で開きます\r\n  - ここに自由に文章を書いていきます\r\n\r\n\r\n- **右側のサイドバー**\r\n  - 開いているページに関連する情報が表示されます\r\n  - リンクされているページの一覧なども表示\r\n\r\n\r\n#### 新しいページの作り方\r\n\r\n\r\n新しいページを作るには2つの方法があります：\r\n\r\n\r\n1. **直接作成する方法**\r\n\r\n\r\n   - 画面上部の検索バーに新しいページ名を入力\r\n   - エンターキーを押すと、新しいページが作られます\r\n\r\n\r\n2. **リンクから作る方法**\r\n   - 文章の中に`[[新しいページ名]]`と書く\r\n   - 自動的にリンクが作られ、クリックで新しいページを作れます\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Markdownで記入する\r\n\r\n\r\nLogSeqでは、Markdownという書き方を使います。難しく考える必要はありません。\r\n以下のような基本的な書き方を覚えましょう：\r\n\r\n\r\n**見出しの書き方**\r\n\r\n\r\n```markdown\r\n# 大見出し\r\n\r\n\r\n## 中見出し\r\n\r\n\r\n### 小見出し\r\n```\r\n\r\n**文字の装飾**\r\n\r\n\r\n```markdown\r\n_斜体で書く_\r\n**太字で書く**\r\n~~打ち消し線~~\r\n```\r\n\r\n**箇条書き**\r\n\r\n\r\n```markdown\r\n- 箇条書き1\r\n  - 箇条書き1-1\r\n  - 箇条書き1-2\r\n- 箇条書き2\r\n```\r\n\r\nこれらの書き方は、実際に使いながら少しずつ覚えていけば大丈夫です。最初は普通の文章を書くところから始めましょう。\r\n\r\n\r\n### 日々のノート作成の基本\r\n\r\n\r\n#### 箇条書きの書き方\r\n\r\n\r\nLogSeqでは、箇条書きを基本としてノートを作成します。箇条書きには、以下のような特徴があります：\r\n\r\n\r\n- **基本の書き方**\r\n\r\n\r\n  - 行頭に「-」（ハイフン）と半角スペースを入力\r\n  - Enterキーを押すと、自動的に次の箇条書きが始まります\r\n  - Tabキーで階層を下げる（字下げ）\r\n  - Shift + Tabで階層を上げる\r\n\r\n\r\n- **箇条書きのコツ**\r\n  - 1つの項目は短めに書く\r\n  - 詳しい説明が必要な場合は、階層を下げて書く\r\n  - 関連する内容は、同じ階層にまとめる\r\n\r\n\r\n#### 日付ページの使い方\r\n\r\n\r\nLogSeqでは、毎日自動的に日付のページ（ジャーナル）が作られます：\r\n\r\n\r\n- **日付ページの特徴**\r\n\r\n\r\n  - 起動時に自動的に今日の日付のページが開く\r\n  - 左サイドバーの「Journals」から過去の日付を開ける\r\n  - 日付ページには、その日に考えたことや行ったことを自由に書ける\r\n\r\n\r\n- **効果的な使い方**\r\n  - 朝：今日やることを箇条書きで書き出す\r\n  - 日中：気づいたことや考えたことをメモ\r\n  - 夜：その日の振り返りを書く\r\n\r\n\r\n#### タグの付け方と活用法\r\n\r\n\r\nタグは情報の整理と検索を助ける強力なツールです。ページリンクと組み合わせることで、より効果的な知識管理が可能になります。\r\n\r\n\r\n- **タグの基本**\r\n\r\n\r\n  - 単語の前に「#」（ハッシュ）を付ける\r\n  - 例：#勉強 #アイデア #ToDo\r\n  - スペースを含む場合は「`#[[読書メモ]]`」のように[[]]で囲む\r\n\r\n\r\n- **タグとページリンクの特徴と使い分け**\r\n\r\n\r\n  - タグ（#）の特徴\r\n\r\n\r\n    - 複数のページに共通する「性質」を示すのに適している\r\n    - 一覧表示やフィルタリングが簡単\r\n    - 例：#未完了、#重要、#要復習\r\n\r\n\r\n  - ページリンク（[[]])の特徴\r\n    - 特定の「主題」についての詳細な記述に適している\r\n    - 概念間の関係性を表現しやすい\r\n    - 例：`[[数学]]`、`[[微分]]`、`[[Newton]]`\r\n\r\n\r\n- **効果的な併用方法**\r\n\r\n\r\n  - 主題と性質を組み合わせる\r\n    - `[[微分]]` のページに #数学 #要復習 を付ける\r\n    - `[[読書記録]]` のページに #継続中 #インプット を付ける\r\n  - 概念の関係性を示す\r\n    - `[[微分]]`のページで `[[極限]]` と `[[関数]]` を参照しつつ、#数学 を付ける\r\n    - `[[Newton]]`のページで `[[力学]]` を参照しつつ、#物理学者 を付ける\r\n\r\n\r\nこのように、タグとページリンクはそれぞれの特徴を活かして使うことで、より効率的な知識管理が可能になります。\r\n\r\n\r\n### 知識のつながりを作る\r\n\r\n\r\n#### ページ間のリンクの作り方\r\n\r\n\r\nLogSeqの強力な特徴は、ページ同士をつなげられることです。知識と知識を結びつけることで、新しい気づきが生まれやすくなります。\r\n\r\n\r\n- **基本的なリンクの作り方**\r\n\r\n\r\n  - `[[ページ名]]` と入力する（`[[`と`]]`で囲む）\r\n  - リンク先のページがなければ、自動的に新しいページが作られる\r\n  - エイリアスをつける場合：`[[ページ名]][表示したい文字]`\r\n    - 例：`[[アインシュタイン]][彼]`と書くと、「彼」と表示される\r\n\r\n\r\n- **効果的なリンクの付け方**\r\n  - 重要な概念や用語が出てきたらリンクにする\r\n  - 関連する話題が出てきたら積極的にリンクする\r\n  - あとで詳しく書きたい内容があればリンクにする\r\n\r\n\r\n#### バックリンクの概念と確認方法\r\n\r\n\r\nバックリンクとは、「どのページからリンクされているか」を示す機能です。自動的に作られる双方向のつながりにより、知識の関係性が見えてきます。\r\n\r\n\r\n- **バックリンクの特徴**\r\n\r\n\r\n  - 自動的に作られる（手動で作る必要はない）\r\n  - 右サイドバーに表示される\r\n  - リンク元のページの該当部分が引用として表示される\r\n\r\n\r\n- **バックリンクの活用法**\r\n  - 関連する記述を後から発見できる\r\n  - 同じ概念が出てくる文脈を確認できる\r\n  - 知識の unexpected な関連性に気づける\r\n\r\n\r\n#### 関連する情報のつながりを見つける方法\r\n\r\n\r\nLogSeqには、知識のつながりを見つけるための様々な機能があります：\r\n\r\n\r\n- **グラフビュー**\r\n\r\n\r\n  - ページ間のつながりを視覚的に表示\r\n  - 右上のグラフアイコンをクリック\r\n  - ノードをクリックすると関連するページに移動\r\n\r\n\r\n- **検索機能の活用**\r\n\r\n\r\n  - キーワードで関連ページを検索\r\n  - タグとページリンクを組み合わせて検索\r\n  - 日付範囲を指定して検索\r\n\r\n\r\n- **知識のつながりを育てる方法**\r\n  - 定期的にバックリンクを確認する\r\n  - 関連しそうなページを積極的にリンクする\r\n  - グラフビューで全体の構造を確認する\r\n\r\n\r\nこのように、LogSeqでは知識同士を様々な方法でつなげることができます。つながりが増えるほど、新しい発見や気づきが生まれやすくなります。\r\n\r\n\r\n### まとめ\r\n\r\n\r\n#### 日常的な使い方のおすすめパターン\r\n\r\n\r\nLogSeqを効果的に活用するために、以下のような使い方がおすすめです：\r\n\r\n\r\n- **1日の基本的な流れ**\r\n\r\n\r\n  - 朝：今日やることを箇条書きで書き出す\r\n  - 日中：思いついたことを `[[]]` でリンクしながらメモ\r\n  - 夜：その日の振り返りと、重要な項目に `#タグ` をつける\r\n\r\n\r\n- **知識を育てる方法**\r\n\r\n\r\n  - 気になる言葉は積極的に `[[]]` でリンク\r\n  - 関連する過去のメモは右サイドバーのバックリンクで確認\r\n  - 時々グラフビューを開いて知識の関係性を見直す\r\n\r\n\r\n- **継続的な活用のコツ**\r\n  - 完璧を目指さず、まずはメモを取ることから始める\r\n  - 少しずつ機能を試して、自分に合う使い方を見つける\r\n  - 定期的に過去のメモを見返して、知識をアップデート\r\n\r\n\r\n#### 困ったときの対処法\r\n\r\n\r\nLogSeqを使っていて困ったときは、以下の方法を試してみましょう：\r\n\r\n\r\n- **書き方を忘れたとき**\r\n\r\n\r\n  - Markdownの基本：`#` で見出し、`-` で箇条書き\r\n  - リンクとタグ：`[[ページ名]]` と `#タグ名`\r\n  - これらは画面下部のヘルプアイコンでいつでも確認可能\r\n\r\n\r\n- **情報が見つからないとき**\r\n\r\n\r\n  - 検索バーに関連するキーワードを入力\r\n  - タグで絞り込み検索\r\n  - グラフビューで関連ページを探す\r\n\r\n\r\n- **整理が必要と感じたとき**\r\n  - 関連する情報を新しいページにまとめる\r\n  - 適切なタグをつけて分類する\r\n  - 不要になったメモは、アーカイブとしてタグ付け\r\n\r\n\r\nLogSeqは、使い始めは普通のメモ帳として、慣れてきたら知識を育てるツールとして活用できます。一度にすべての機能を使いこなす必要はありません。自分のペースで、少しずつ使い方を広げていってください。\r\n",

Although it was produced in small quantities, I was fortunate enough to get my hands on one.\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/170124/2024/r0000634.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" alt=\"PPSE Classic and PPSE'79\">\n\nVin Antique has previously released an overdrive pedal called PPSE '79 which received high praise, and this PPSE Classic is considered its sister version. PPSE stands for \"Pike Place Smoky Emerald\", named after the color of the sign at Seattle's Pike Place Market, and this color is applied to the aluminum CNC-machined pedal enclosure.\nAs this is the \"Classic\" version, it's painted in a slightly more vivid color than the PPSE '79, representing \"the sign's color before it faded\".\n\n\nWhile the PPSE '79 features asymmetric clipping that produces a gritty distortion rich in harmonics, the PPSE Classic uses symmetric clipping that's closer to the original Tube Screamer, providing a well-defined tone that's great for boosting your amp.\n\n\nI might connect both in series to switch between them.\n\n\nBelow is a sound sample where I play with the PPSE Classic in the first half and the PPSE '79 in the second half.\n\n---\n\n京都発の小さなエフェクターブランド Vin Antiqueから新しいOver Drive \"PPSE Classic\"が発売されました。小ロットしか出荷されなかったようですが、幸いにも入手できました。\n\n\nVin AntiqueはPPSE '79というOver Driveをリリースしており高い評価を受けていますが、今回のPPSE Classicは姉妹版ということになります。 PPSEは\"Pike Place Smoky Emerald\"の略でシアトルのパイクプレース・マーケットの看板の色に因んだネーミングだそうで、\nアルミ削り出しのエフェクター筐体がその色に塗られています。\n今回Classicということで「看板の褪色する前の色」ということで PPSE'79より若干鮮やかな色で塗装されています。\n\n\nPPSE'79が非対称クリッピングで倍音を多く含んだざらっとした歪みなのに対して、PPSE Classicは対称クリッピングで本家のTube Screamerに近く輪郭がしっかりしアンプをブーストするのにいい感じです。\n\n\nどちらも直列に繋いで使い分けようかな。\n\n\n以下は前半はPPSE Classic、後半をPPSE'79で弾き分けたものです。\n\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/1994590239%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-mp7HmTV1YPZ&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe><div style=\"font-size: 10px; color: #cccccc;line-break: anywhere;word-break: normal;overflow: hidden;white-space: nowrap;text-overflow: ellipsis; font-family: Interstate,Lucida Grande,Lucida Sans Unicode,Lucida Sans,Garuda,Verdana,Tahoma,sans-serif;font-weight: 100;\"><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/yostos\" title=\"Yostos\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: #cccccc; text-decoration: none;\">Yostos</a> · <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/yostos/12-bar-daily-sessions-08-08-08/s-mp7HmTV1YPZ\" title=\"12-Bar Daily Sessions 08 - 08 - 08\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: #cccccc; text-decoration: none;\">12-Bar Daily Sessions 08 - 08 - 08</a></div>\n",

The era that gave rise to a generation of people who celebrated automation and reveled in the joy of computing, when transistors replaced cogs, and machine-readable typefaces were developed, for when humans and machines truly interfaced on an unprecedented scale.</p>\n<cite>Berkeley Graphics - <a href=\"https://berkeleygraphics.com/typefaces/berkeley-mono/\">Berkeley Mono</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n確かにちょっと懐かしい「コンピューター」らしい文字のデザインです。\n\n気に入っている点は、次の3点です。\n\n- ちょうど良い文字間隔\n- スクエアなデザイン\n- 買い切りでWebフォントまで含んでいる\n\n特に文字間隔や高さが日本語フォントとバランス良いよいに思います。\n\n### フォント比較\n\n以下のスクリーンショットは、適当なプログラムCascadia Next / MonoLisa / Berkeley Monoを使って表示させた例です。\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/170124/2024/fonts.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"332\" alt=\"Fonts Comparison\">\n\n文字間隔の違いがよくわかると思います。\n",

				"content_html": "<h3 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h3>\n<p>I’ve been using SILKYPIX to develop RAW images captured with my RICOH GR IIIx. However, I’ve recently started wondering: <em>Is it really worth continuing to use this software?</em></p>\n<p>There are two main reasons for my hesitation:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The processing takes a significant amount of time.</li>\n<li>The preview feature is sluggish, and the software frequently freezes after extended use.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>With macOS now supporting RAW files natively, a variety of apps are available for editing these files. To explore my options, I wrote a Python-based image comparison tool and analyzed three images to see how they stack up:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Image 1</strong>: A JPEG file developed using the macOS version of SILKYPIX, without any adjustments.</li>\n<li><strong>Image 2</strong>: A JPEG file developed using Pixelmator Pro, also without adjustments. Pixelmator Pro takes advantage of macOS&rsquo;s native RAW support, ensuring high compatibility and efficient processing of RAW files.</li>\n<li><strong>Image 3</strong>: A JPEG image saved directly from the GR IIIx at the time of capture, with the &ldquo;Negative Film&rdquo; preset applied via Image Control.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"1-analyzing-the-jpeg-files-using-data\">1. Analyzing the JPEG Files Using Data</h3>\n<p>The image I used for comparison was a park scene with autumn leaves illuminated by the setting sun.</p>\n<p>Here are the results from my Python program:</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4\"><code class=\"language-sh\" data-lang=\"sh\">❯ python three-image-comparison.py\n\n\nImage <span style=\"color:#ae81ff\">1</span> Analysis:\nSize: <span style=\"color:#f92672\">(</span>4000, 6000, 3<span style=\"color:#f92672\">)</span>\nMean Brightness: 85.267\nStandard Deviation: 72.58\nMean Saturation: 113.675\nContrast: <span style=\"color:#ae81ff\">255</span>\nFile Size<span style=\"color:#f92672\">(</span>KB<span style=\"color:#f92672\">)</span>: 19070.3955078125\n\n\nImage <span style=\"color:#ae81ff\">2</span> Analysis:\nSize: <span style=\"color:#f92672\">(</span>4000, 6000, 3<span style=\"color:#f92672\">)</span>\nMean Brightness: 66.147\nStandard Deviation: 73.611\nMean Saturation: 135.691\nContrast: <span style=\"color:#ae81ff\">255</span>\nFile Size<span style=\"color:#f92672\">(</span>KB<span style=\"color:#f92672\">)</span>: 29992.3681640625\n\n\nImage <span style=\"color:#ae81ff\">3</span> Analysis:\nSize: <span style=\"color:#f92672\">(</span>4000, 6000, 3<span style=\"color:#f92672\">)</span>\nMean Brightness: 93.122\nStandard Deviation: 74.255\nMean Saturation: 85.623\nContrast: <span style=\"color:#ae81ff\">255</span>\nFile Size<span style=\"color:#f92672\">(</span>KB<span style=\"color:#f92672\">)</span>: 13395.0634765625\n\n\nComparison Results:\nSSIM 1-2: 0.68\nSSIM 1-3: 0.847\nSSIM 2-3: 0.737\nHistogram Correlation 1-2: 0.3822719180861183\nHistogram Correlation 1-3: 0.7985840630919663\nHistogram Correlation 2-3: 0.13442670111231494\n</code></pre></div><h3 id=\"2-insights-from-the-image-comparison\">2. Insights from the Image Comparison</h3>\n<h4 id=\"21-image-comparison-results\">2.1. Image Comparison Results</h4>\n<p>The characteristics of each image based on the data are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>SILKYPIX Image</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Moderate brightness with a calm tone.</li>\n<li>Adequate saturation, achieving a balance of vibrancy and naturalness.</li>\n<li>Stable brightness, resulting in a uniform finish.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Pixelmator Pro Image</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>The darkest output, emphasizing shadows.</li>\n<li>The highest saturation, focusing on vibrancy.</li>\n<li>Dynamic tonal changes, creating a dramatic impression.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>GR IIIx Jpeg Image (Negative Film Style)</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>The brightest output, with a light and soft tone.</li>\n<li>The lowest saturation, offering a calm and natural color palette.</li>\n<li>Moderate brightness variation, providing smooth and natural gradation.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>From the comparison results, the following observations can be made:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Based on <strong>SSIM (Structural Similarity Index)</strong>, SILKYPIX and Pixelmator Pro exhibit significantly different structures, with notable differences in brightness and saturation. The GR IIIx Jpeg is relatively similar to SILKYPIX but with more subdued saturation.</li>\n<li>According to the <strong>Histogram Correlation</strong>, SILKYPIX and Pixelmator Pro show distinctly different color distributions. When compared to GR IIIx Jpeg, SILKYPIX has some similarity, while Pixelmator Pro displays significant differences.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"22-evaluating-raw-development-apps\">2.2. Evaluating RAW Development Apps</h4>\n<p>Based on the analysis, here’s my evaluation of each tool:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>SILKYPIX</strong><br>\nSILKYPIX delivers vivid colors and a balanced brightness level, making it ideal for landscapes or scenes where vibrant colors are essential. Its versatility makes it suitable for various scenarios.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Pixelmator Pro</strong><br>\nWith its darker tones and shadow emphasis, Pixelmator Pro works well for dramatic compositions or print projects. However, additional adjustments might be required for darker areas.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>GR IIIx JPEG (Negative Film Preset)</strong><br>\nThe GR IIIx JPEG provides a bright, soft tone with natural colors, making it great for everyday photography and relaxed scenes.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"3-final-thoughts\">3. Final Thoughts</h3>\n<p>From this comparison, SILKYPIX proves to be a reliable tool, and the numerical data supports its strengths. Surprisingly, I found myself drawn to the GR IIIx JPEG with the Negative Film preset.</p>\n<p>A practical workflow could be to shoot in RAW + JPEG mode, using the JPEGs directly for most situations and turning to SILKYPIX for advanced adjustments when needed.</p>\n<h3 id=\"appendix-python-program-for-image-analysis\">Appendix.

				"content_text": "### Introduction\n\n\nI’ve been using SILKYPIX to develop RAW images captured with my RICOH GR IIIx. However, I’ve recently started wondering: _Is it really worth continuing to use this software?_\n\n\nThere are two main reasons for my hesitation:\n\n\n1. The processing takes a significant amount of time.\n2. The preview feature is sluggish, and the software frequently freezes after extended use.\n\n\nWith macOS now supporting RAW files natively, a variety of apps are available for editing these files. To explore my options, I wrote a Python-based image comparison tool and analyzed three images to see how they stack up:\n\n\n- **Image 1**: A JPEG file developed using the macOS version of SILKYPIX, without any adjustments.\n- **Image 2**: A JPEG file developed using Pixelmator Pro, also without adjustments. Pixelmator Pro takes advantage of macOS's native RAW support, ensuring high compatibility and efficient processing of RAW files.\n- **Image 3**: A JPEG image saved directly from the GR IIIx at the time of capture, with the \"Negative Film\" preset applied via Image Control.\n\n<!--more-->\n\n\n### 1. Analyzing the JPEG Files Using Data\n\n\nThe image I used for comparison was a park scene with autumn leaves illuminated by the setting sun. \n\n\nHere are the results from my Python program:\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/170124/2024/comparison-result.webp\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" alt=\"Result of Comparison\">\n\n\n```sh\n❯ python three-image-comparison.py\n\n\nImage 1 Analysis:\nSize: (4000, 6000, 3)\nMean Brightness: 85.267\nStandard Deviation: 72.58\nMean Saturation: 113.675\nContrast: 255\nFile Size(KB): 19070.3955078125\n\n\nImage 2 Analysis:\nSize: (4000, 6000, 3)\nMean Brightness: 66.147\nStandard Deviation: 73.611\nMean Saturation: 135.691\nContrast: 255\nFile Size(KB): 29992.3681640625\n\n\nImage 3 Analysis:\nSize: (4000, 6000, 3)\nMean Brightness: 93.122\nStandard Deviation: 74.255\nMean Saturation: 85.623\nContrast: 255\nFile Size(KB): 13395.0634765625\n\n\nComparison Results:\nSSIM 1-2: 0.68\nSSIM 1-3: 0.847\nSSIM 2-3: 0.737\nHistogram Correlation 1-2: 0.3822719180861183\nHistogram Correlation 1-3: 0.7985840630919663\nHistogram Correlation 2-3: 0.13442670111231494\n```\n### 2. Insights from the Image Comparison\n\n\n#### 2.1. Image Comparison Results\n\n\nThe characteristics of each image based on the data are as follows:\n\n\n-   **SILKYPIX Image**\n    -   Moderate brightness with a calm tone.\n    -   Adequate saturation, achieving a balance of vibrancy and naturalness.\n    -   Stable brightness, resulting in a uniform finish.\n-   **Pixelmator Pro Image**\n    -   The darkest output, emphasizing shadows.\n    -   The highest saturation, focusing on vibrancy.\n    -   Dynamic tonal changes, creating a dramatic impression.\n-   **GR IIIx Jpeg Image (Negative Film Style)**\n    -   The brightest output, with a light and soft tone.\n    -   The lowest saturation, offering a calm and natural color palette.\n    -   Moderate brightness variation, providing smooth and natural gradation.\n\n\nFrom the comparison results, the following observations can be made:\n\n\n-   Based on **SSIM (Structural Similarity Index)**, SILKYPIX and Pixelmator Pro exhibit significantly different structures, with notable differences in brightness and saturation. The GR IIIx Jpeg is relatively similar to SILKYPIX but with more subdued saturation.\n-   According to the **Histogram Correlation**, SILKYPIX and Pixelmator Pro show distinctly different color distributions. When compared to GR IIIx Jpeg, SILKYPIX has some similarity, while Pixelmator Pro displays significant differences.\n\n\n#### 2.2. Evaluating RAW Development Apps\n\n\nBased on the analysis, here’s my evaluation of each tool:\n\n\n- **SILKYPIX**  \n  SILKYPIX delivers vivid colors and a balanced brightness level, making it ideal for landscapes or scenes where vibrant colors are essential. Its versatility makes it suitable for various scenarios.\n\n\n- **Pixelmator Pro**  \n  With its darker tones and shadow emphasis, Pixelmator Pro works well for dramatic compositions or print projects. However, additional adjustments might be required for darker areas.\n\n\n- **GR IIIx JPEG (Negative Film Preset)**  \n  The GR IIIx JPEG provides a bright, soft tone with natural colors, making it great for everyday photography and relaxed scenes.\n\n\n### 3. Final Thoughts\n\n\nFrom this comparison, SILKYPIX proves to be a reliable tool, and the numerical data supports its strengths. Surprisingly, I found myself drawn to the GR IIIx JPEG with the Negative Film preset.\n\n\nA practical workflow could be to shoot in RAW + JPEG mode, using the JPEGs directly for most situations and turning to SILKYPIX for advanced adjustments when needed.\n\n\n### Appendix. Python Program for Image Analysis\n\n\nHere is the Python program I used for this analysis. It’s a quick and simple script, so it includes hard-coded file names for convenience.

				"content_text": "すっかり寒くなり、先週末にGoogle Cloudの資格取得で新橋に行ったときにすっかり\n風邪を引いてしまいました。\n\n\n今週は次の3つのトピックです。\n\n\n- VMWareデスクトップ製品無償化\n- Google Cloud Digital Leader認定資格\n- Fender ストラトキャスターについて\n\n<!--more-->\n\n### VMwareデスクトップ製品無償化\n\n\nVMwareは2024年11月13日、デスクトップ向け仮想化製品のWorkstation ProとFusion Proの完全無償化を[発表](https://blogs.vmware.com/cloud-foundation/2024/11/11/vmware-fusion-and-workstation-are-now-free-for-all-users/)しました。商用利用を含むすべての利用が可能となり、Pro版の全機能が制限なく使えるようになります。\n\n\n個人的は歓迎ですが、企業には不安が広がっているようです。\n\n\n#### BroadcomによるVMWare買収に関するこれまでの懸念\n\n\nそもそもBroadcomの買収により、ユーザー企業は非常に混乱していました。\n\n\n買収後、vSphereやvSANなどのエンタープライズ向け製品の価格が最大300%上昇していました。\n\n\n年間売上高50万ドル未満のパートナーがプログラムから除外され、多くの企業が混乱に直面していました。また、サポート品質の低下や技術者の離職も相次ぎ、代替製品への移行を検討する企業が増加していました。\n\n\n#### VMWare無償化の影響\n\n\n今回個人開発者や小規模チーム向けのデスクトップ製品（WorkstationとFusion）を無償化する一方で、\nデータセンターで使用されるエンタープライズ製品の価格は更に引き上げられています。\n\n\nこの対照的な動きは、Broadcomが大規模企業向けビジネスに集中し、中小規模の顧客を切り捨てる戦略を示唆しています。\n無償化された製品のサポートはコミュニティベースとなり、企業ユーザーの不安は一層深まっています。\n\n\n私がAWS在職中もVMWareを使ってCloud移行を検討していたお客様も多く居ましたが、\nVMware Cloud on AWSについてはAWS及びそのチャネルパートナーによる直接販売が終\n了しライセンスコストも上がったと聞いています。\n\n\nオンプレミスのVMWareをそのままCloudに移行するというのは以前よく行われていましたが、\n全くお勧めしません。\n\n\n### Google Cloud / Cloud DIgital Leader認定資格\n\n\nGoogle Cloud2 の\"Cloud Digital Leader(CDL)\" とは、Google Cloudの基礎的な知識、 Google Cloudの概要や各サービスの特徴、基本的な利用方法を理解しているという資格認定です。\nAmazon Web Services(AWS)の資格で言うと、\"Cloud Practitioner\"に当たるものかな と思います。\n\n\n暇だったので今週受験してきました。AWSの知識があれば、多分この程度で「Compute Engine ってAWSのEC2ね」などと大体 対応が理解できるので十分かなと思います。\n\n\nCloud Digital Leaderは初学者向けなので、次のような人が目指すとよいと思いま す。\n\n\n- 職種はNon Techだが、クラウドを利用したシステムの開発や運営に何らかの形で関 わる方\n- これから技術職を目指す学生や、他職種から転職を目指す方\n\n\nあくまで初学者レベルなので、業務で扱うことのある技術者であればCloud Digital Leaderはスキップして Associate Cloud Engineerを目指したほうが よいと思います。\n会社が「とにかく資格、バッチ取ってこい よ」というモードで報償金が出る場合は\n別ですが。\n\n\n### Fender ストラトキャスターについて\n\n\n今週はFender 70th Anniversary American Vintage II 1954 Stratocasterを購入し\nてテンションが上がっているので、ストラトキャスターについて語ってみたいと思い\nます。\n\n\n私がギターを始めた頃の1970年代から80年代はハードロックが流行っていて、ギターシーンではレスポールやハムバッカー搭載のギターが主流でした。当時はエリック・クラプトン、ジェフ・ベック、ジミー・ペイジといったギターヒーローたちの影響で、ハイゲインとサスティーンの得やすいレスポールが好まれていました。\n\n\n80年代後半になると、ストラトキャスターの形状をベースにハムバッカーやロッキングトレモロを搭載した「スーパーストラト」が台頭。しかし、これは伝統的なストラトキャスターとは別もので、Fenderはそれほど注目されていなかったと思います\n。\n\n\n転機は2000年代以降で音楽シーンがグランジやオルタナティブロックへと変化し、ハードロックはもはやオールディーズになりました。それに伴いテクニカルなソロよりもバンドサウンドに溶け込むギターワークが重視されるようになりました。\nまたエフェクター技術の進化によりシングルコイルの弱点だった出力の低さやサスティーンの短さも克服されました。\n\n\nこうなるとハムバッカーの音しかでないレスポールよりも、\nむしろストラトキャスターの3ピックアップによる多彩な音色が好まれるようになり\nました。\n。\n現在、ストラトキャスターの人気は過去最高潮に達しています。2020年にはフェンダー社の売上が過去最高を記録し、\n特に若い世代や女性プレイヤーの増加が顕著です。\nその理由として、クリアで多様なトーン、演奏性の高さ、そして軽量で扱いやすいボディが、現代の多様な音楽表現に適していることが挙げられます。\n\n\nCustom Shopなど100万円を超える価格でFender自らが「投資」というようなのはどう\nかと思いますが、今購入するギターとしては、本質的な魅力を失うことなく進化を続けながら\n現代の音楽シーンにおいてその価値を高めているストラトキャスターはお勧めのギ\nターです。\n\n",

Japan のJVシリーズやGibsonのサブブランドであった日本製のEpiphoneは、\n現在でも世界中のギタリストから高い評価を受けています。\nまた、GRECO、TOKAI、フェルナンデスといった国産ブラン\nドは、単なるコピーを超えて、独自の価値を創造していきました。\n\n\n製造当時数万円程度で販売されていた製品が、状態の良いものであれば現在では軽く\n10万円を超える価格で取引されるなど、国内外で高い評価を受けています。特に、精\n密な工作機械と熟練した職人技による優れた製造品質、そして独特のビンテージ感が\n絶妙なバランスで共存する点が、現代のギタリストやコレクターを魅了し続けていま\nす。また、近年では若手ミュージシャンの間でもジャパンビンテージギターの人気が\n再燃しており、その独特のサウンドと雰囲気が新たな音楽シーンを創造する一助と\nなっています。\n\n\n私のSV-600も状態がよければ、過去のオークションで10〜20万とかなり高価格\nで取引されています。\n\n\n### Amazon週5日出社に対するAWS社員の反対書簡\n\n\nBusiness Insederに「[【全文公開】Amazon社員523人、週5日出社｢礼賛｣した最高幹部に｢徹底批判｣書簡を提出](https://www.businessinsider.jp/post-296229)」という記事(有料会員限定)が掲載されていました。\n\n\nAmazonでは以前から\"Return to Office\"は社内では言われていましたが、9月にCEOのAndrew Jassyがより厳格な指示を出し、これに対してAWSのCEOであるMatt Garmanが指示を表明したところ、従業員から反発が上がり社内で500人以上におよぶ従業員が書名して彼に反対意見を述べる書簡を提示したという記事です。\n\n\n書簡の主旨は在宅勤務も含めたワークスタイルがあることが生産性向上やイノベーションにつながるという点はもちろんですが、Mattの発言がAmazonの根本理念に反しているという次の主張が目を引きました。\n\n\n- 「従業員の10人中9人は今回の変更を相当楽しみにしているのだと思っています。」というMattの発言はデータの根拠がない「思っています」と印象で、「**データ駆動**」を自ら謳う企業風土に相応しくなく、リモートワークのメリットを経験した当事者としての従業員、そうした経験を裏付ける詳細なデータを把握している従業員からの信頼を損なう。\n- 従わない社員については「勤務先として他の会社もある」などの発言は、AmazonのLeadership Principlesにも反する。\n\n\n後者の少し分かりにくいかもしれませんが、Amazonでは[Leadership Principles](https://www.amazon.jobs/content/en/our-workplace/leadership-principles)というものが定義されています。日本だと「社訓」が近いかもしれませんが、社訓よりもより具体的な行動指針や判断基準として定義されています。社内では\"Our Leadership Principles\"を略して\"**OLP**\"と呼ばれあらゆる場面で使われています。\n\n\n採用面接でもOLPからいくつかのPrinciplesが選ばれデモンストレーションできる逸\n話を求められますし、社内の人事評価でもOLPに従った評価が行われます。社内会議\nなどでも「その提案はOLPのCustomer Obsessionに沿ってない」などと普通に使われ\nていて入社した当時面食らったものです。\n\n\nと言うわけで、「OLPに反している」などと社内で公然と指摘されるのかなり厳しい\n状況と思えますが、Mattはこれからどうするのか見ていきたいと思います。\n\n\n私が在職していた頃も、AWS Japanでも営業職などは週3日程度出社するような指示が出ていたようです。\n私が所属していたサービス部隊ではオフィスより顧客先に出向くことのほうが多いので、この指示からは除外するように運営していました。その後、どうなっているのでしょうか。\n\n### 原付50cc時代の終焉 ～新たなモビリティ文化への転換点～\n\n\nホンダが「[スーパーカブ・Final\nEdition](https://global.honda/jp/news/2024/2241101-supercub50.html)」を発表\nし、このモデルをもってスーパーカブ50ccの生産を終了することを発表しました。\n1958年の発売以来、世界累計生産台数1億台を超えるこの愛されてきたモデルは、日\n本のモータリゼーションを支え続けてきました。かつて年間278万台もの国内出荷を\n誇っていた原付50ccも、いまでは9万2000台にまで減ってしまったそうです。\n\n\n生産終了の大きなきっかけとなったのは、2025年11月からスタートする排ガス規制の\n強化です。特に50cc車両では、排ガスをきれいにするために必要な触媒の温度を保つ\nことが難しく、技術的な壁に直面していました。新しい規制に対応するための投資も\n必要ですが、残念ながら市場規模が小さくなりすぎて、採算が合わなくなってしまっ\nたようです。2017年に生産拠点を中国から日本に戻したばかりなのに残念なことで\nす。\n\n\n50ccバイクは、私も大学時代に通学で使っていました。\n当時「125キラー」と呼ばれ125ccも追い回せると言われたYAMAHAのRZ50に乗っていま\nした。通学や新社会人の足として、ある年代以上の方はきっと多くの方の青春の思い出\nの一部となっているはずです。\n環境面でも、小排気量ならではの省エネ性や、都市部での手軽な移動手段として、\nとても優れた乗り物でした。でも、時代は新しい方向に進み始めています。\n125cc以下4kW制限の新基準バイクや電動バイクなど、次世代のモビリティへの転換期を迎えているんですね。\n半世紀以上にわたって日本の街を走り続けてきた原付50ccが静かに歴史の1ページを閉じると思うと感慨深いです。\n\n\n漫画「オーバーレブ！」を描いていた山口かつみ先生がバイクについて描いた「[Ｍｙ　Ｆａｖｏｒｉｔｅ　ＢＩＫＥ](https://amzn.to/3Asjw3s)にスーパーカブやRZ50のエピソードがあったのを思い出してKindleで買い直しました。なつかしいなぁ。\n\n\n<div

				"content_text": "昨日くらいから随分と秋らしくなりました。\n今週は自宅キッチンのリフォームのためあまりニュースなどを追えませんでした。\n\nトピックは次の3つです。\n\n- 『機動警察パトレイバー THE MOVIE』を見て\n- ジャーナルツール jrnl\n-  自動車業界におけるITについて\n\n<!--more-->\n\n###『機動警察パトレイバー THE MOVIE』リバイバル上映を見て\n\n\n1989年公開の『機動警察パトレイバー THE MOVIE』のリバイバル上映を最近鑑賞しました。当初は「思い出補正」による過大評価を懸念していましたが、予想に反して作品の質の高さを再確認できました。同時に、この作品が描いた未来と現実との乖離も強く感じました。\n\n\nこの作品が公開された1989年は、振り返ってみると非常に象徴的な年でした。\n\n\n- 昭和天皇の崩御\n- 三菱地所によるロックフェラー・センター買収\n- 任天堂によるゲームボーイの発売\n\n\nこれらの出来事を見ると、1989年は、政治、経済、テクノロジーなど様々な面で日本にとって大きな転換点となった年だったのです。\n\n\n「バブル」の絶頂期で作品で描かれているよう東京は再開発され「古き良き日本」はどんどんなくなり、作品で描かれている湾岸地区は当時とも全く姿を変えています。一方で当時の楽観的な技術観を反映した『機動警察パトレイバー THE MOVIE』に描かれる近未来の世界観とは異なり、いま日本は技術大国としての道筋から外れむしろ海外企業の技術に依存する状況に陥っています。\n\n\n本作は、1989年という転換期の日本を背景に、技術の進歩と社会の変化、そしてそれらがもたらす光と影を鮮やかに描き出しています。リバイバル上映を通じて、作品の質の高さだけでなく、描かれた未来と現実の差異、そして当時の日本が抱いていた技術的野心と現在の状況を比較し、深い示唆を得ることができました。\n\n\n### ジャーナルツール jrnl\n\n\n少し前からコマンドラインから使用できるジャーナルツール jrnlを使用しています。\n\n\n備忘のため記録を付けたいだけで日記を書くつもりはないので最低限のことができればよいのですが、Inkdrop/Obsidian/Logseqなどは高機能すぎて面倒でした。コマンドラインからメモツールとして`nb`も使っていますが、ジャーナルに特化していません。\n\n\njrnlはただただプレーンテキストでエントリーを記録することができます。日付も自\n動で入りますし、余計な機能はあまりなく、気に入っています。MacではHomebrewを\n使えば簡単にインストールできます。\n\n\n```sh\nbrew install jrnl\n```\n折角なのでドキュメントの日本語化を行いました。本体にマージしてもらうようPull Requestをしていますが、プロジェクトのビルド設定に問題があるようで時間がかかりそうです。個人的にコピーしたリポジトリでGitHub Pagesで[日本語版](https://yostos.github.io/jrnl-j/ja/usage/)を公開していおきました。\n\n\n### 自動車業界におけるITについて\n\n\nマイカーで使用しているメーカー指定のデンソーテン製ドライブレコーダーのSDカードがメディア破損してしまいました。交換しようとしましたが、驚いたことを純正は容量の少ないSDカードを法外な価格でしか提供していません。\n\n\n有る程度の容量があるSDカードのほうが書き込みが分散しセル当たりの書き込み回数が減って耐久性が上がるはずなので、普通のHigh EnduranceのSDカードを購入しました。しかし、これでは毎回「非純正SDカード」という警告が出るので警告を抑止する設定が必要です。ところが、対応するスマホアプリはダイアログからOKボタンがはみ出すという初歩的で致命的なバグがあり初期設定すらできません。パソコン版のビューアーアプリはWidnows版しか提供しておらず、Macがサポートされていません。仕方なくディーラーで設定してもらいました。\n[GlobalStats](https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/desktop/worldwide/#monthly-200901-202408)の情報を見ると、Windowsのシェアは結構下がっており、Macは20%程度のシェアがあります。\n自動車業界は自動運転にフォーカスし米巨大テック企業がこぞって参加しようという状況なのに、ソフトウェア開発は社外に放り投げてマルチプラットフォームのサポートもしない日本の自動車関連機器メーカーとしてはのんびりしたもんです。\n\n",

BedRockについて\n\n\nAmazon BedRockは、AWSが提供する生成AI向けのマネージドサービスです。最近、日本市場でもその活用事例が徐々に増えてきており、例えば[KDDI](https://aws.amazon.com/jp/blogs/news/aws-genai-usecases-kddi-agile-minutes/)が議事録作成の効率化にBedRockを利用するなど、具体的な適用例が出始めています。\n\n\nAmazon BedRockの主なメリットとして、以下の2点が挙げられます：\n\n\n1. **各生成AIモデルのAPI差異の吸収**: \n   BedRockは、複数のAIプロバイダー（Anthropic、Amazon、AI21 Labs、Stabilitiy AI等）のモデルに対して統一的なインターフェースを提供します。これにより、開発者は個々のAPIの違いを意識せずに、様々なモデルを利用・比較できるとされています。\n\n\n2. **AWSエコシステムとの統合**: \n   AWSの既存サービスとシームレスに連携でき、管理面やコスト面で利点があります。例えば、IAMを使用した統一的なアクセス管理、CloudWatchを利用したモニタリングとロギング、AWSの請求システムを通じた一元的なコスト管理などが可能です。\n\n\nしかし、各生成AIモデルのAPI差異の吸収というメリットについては、実際のところそれほど大きなアドバンテージにならない可能性があります。多くの生成AIモデルのAPIは基本的な構造が似通っており、レスポンスの処理に多少の違いがあるだけです。この点について、[サンプルコード](https://github.com/yostos/ai_api_samples)を作成して検証してみました。\n\n\nまとめると、モデル依存性を排除するための利用としては、BedRockのメリットをあまり感じられません。確かに、AWSとの管理面やコスト面での統合によるメリットは存在しますが、一方で新しいAIエンジンへのアクセスが遅くなるというデメリットもあります。\n\n\nこれらの要因を考慮すると、個人利用の場合はBedRockの採用をやや敬遠したい気持ちになります。組織の規模や既存のAWS利用状況、セキュリティ要件などによっては有用な選択肢となる可能性はありますが、個々の状況に応じて慎重に評価する必要があるでしょう。\n\n(元AWSですが、特にBedRockに関係した訳ではなく、これはあくまで個人的な見解です。)\n\n### 自民党総裁選\n\n\n自民党総裁選挙が9月27日に予定されています。\n政治にそれほど興味があるわけではありませんが、小泉進次郎氏の動向には\n楽しめています。\n\n\n当初「小泉進次郎で総裁選は決まり」のような報道もあったので意外でした。\n\n\nただ、露出するごとに評価を落としているようで面白いな思っておっています。\n岸田総理に挑む若手と言う構図で改革を大義に名乗りを上げたのに、当の岸田総理が退任表明して大義を失ったのは不運でしたが、その後も露出するごとに迷言を繰り返し、以前の発言も掘り起こされてついに「小泉構文」と言う流行語までできてしまいました。\n\n\n並べてみると\n\n\n- 自民党総裁選挙会見で「改革」を56回連呼\n- 「自分が話している姿を映像で見るのが一番のコミュニケーションの勉強です」\n- 「言葉には体温と体重を乗せる」\n- カナダのトルドー首相、金正恩朝鮮労働党総書記との同世代アピール\n- 「今のままではいけないと思います。だからこそ日本は今のままではいけないと思っています」\n- 「何事も一回やってみてください。次にやる時は二回目になりますから。」\n- 「野球部員だった私は水筒を使っていたけど、環境配慮の観点で水筒を使っていなかった。」\n- 「政治に無関心であることは政治に無関心のままでいられる。」\n\n\n「何言ってんの？　この人」と笑える中毒性があります。\n\n\n\n\n### キッチン改装\n\n\n25年近く使ってきた自宅のキッチンの排水パイプが壊れたりと不具合がで始めたので思い切ってリフォームをお願いしました。今週から改装に入っています。\n\n\n25年も経つと個人のニーズの変化やキッチン関連器具の進歩で、結構違うものですね。今回のリフォームのポイントとして、次の３点をテーマとしました。\n\n\n- ビルトインの食洗機は5年くらいのサイクルで故障しその度に修理や買い替えで苦労しました。今回は家族も減ったので思い切って食洗機はやめました。\n- 換気扇の油汚れの掃除が手間でしたが、今回は換気扇に特殊なコーティングが施され付着した油はそのままトレーに落ちるので10年間手入れ不要と言うに変えました。\n- 浄水器はBritaのものを使っていましたが、PFASなど心配も多いのでビルトインで浄水器を組み込んでもらいました。\n\n\nこれが人生最後のキッチンリフォームだと思うので、使い勝手がよくなればいいなと思います。\n\n\n\n\n\n",

				"content_html": "<p>今週は残暑にやられてしまし、体調を崩してしまいました。</p>\n<p>今週の気になった記事や出来事は次の4つです。</p>\n<ul>\n<li>フジテレビ「牛の屠殺」発言について</li>\n<li>CharGPT o1-previewがリリース</li>\n<li>今更ながらAmazon Q Developerを試す</li>\n<li>個人のタスク管理について</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"フジテレビ牛の屠殺発言について\">フジテレビ、「牛の屠殺」発言について</h2>\n<p>9月12日の情報番組「ぽかぽか」で高畑淳子さんが通院した病院の対応　を「牛の屠殺みたいに」と表現しました。これに対して、フジテレビは「職業差別を助長する恐れがある不適切な表現」として、翌日の番組内で発言の取り消しと謝罪を行いました。</p>\n<p>遡ると1989年には、TBSの「NEWS21」で故・筑紫哲也氏が、麻薬問題で荒れるニューヨークを「残酷な殺し合いの場」として「屠殺場」という言葉を使用し、批判を受けたことがありました。全芝浦屠場労組と全横浜屠場労組がこれに抗議し、筑紫氏は約1年かけて彼らと議論し、自身の発言の差別性を明らかにした上で謝罪しました。</p>\n<p>「屠殺」という言葉の使用が差別的であったか考えてみましょう。「屠殺」を推奨される「食肉処理」に置き換えると、そのニュアンスがわかりやすくなります。</p>\n<p>筑紫氏の発言では、「残酷な殺し合い＝食肉処理」となり、問題があります。一方、高畑さんの場合、「流れ作業的＝食肉処理」との例えです。これは的確とは言えないものの、差別的な要素があるかは疑問です。一般的に「流れ作業的」なことを工場の「ベルトコンベア」に例えることがありますが、「食肉センター」が合理的で効率的であると指摘することは差別的なのでしょうか。</p>\n<p>私は問題なのはフジテレビの対応にあると思っています。主に2点です。</p>\n<ul>\n<li>筑紫氏のようにその意図の確認や検証の過程を明らかにせず、「職業差別を助長する恐れがある不適切発言」と断定したこと。</li>\n<li>発言者である高畑さんが不在の中で、フジテレビが謝罪したこと。</li>\n</ul>\n<p>これでは、フジテレビが言葉狩りを行い、出演者を「差別的」と断罪し、一方的に謝罪を発信したように見えます。</p>\n<p>「屠殺」という言葉は古くは757年に施行された「養老律令」でも使用されています。「謂。元謀屠殺、其計已成、身雖不行、仍為首罪合斬」（屠殺を計画し、その計画が成立していれば、自ら行動しなくても首謀者として斬刑に処されるべきである）とあります。このように、「屠殺」とは単に「殺す」という意味であり、差別的なニュアンスは含まれてません。現に隣国の中国でも韓国でも用語として「屠殺」が普通に使用されています。</p>\n<p>さらに日本の「畜産物衛生管理法」第7条にて「（家畜の<strong>屠殺</strong>等）①家畜の<strong>屠殺</strong>・処理、集油、畜産物の加工・包装及び保管は、第22条第1項により許可を受けた作業場でしなければならない。 」と明記されています。一般的な用語であることがわかります。</p>\n<p>報道機関などでよく参照される共同通信社の『記者ハンドブック』では「屠殺」は「食肉処理」への言い換えが奨励されいます。差別的な概念を含まず歴史があり隣国も使用し日本でも法令が使用する言葉をなぜか封じ込めようとする。</p>\n<p>バカな話です。</p>\n<h2 id=\"chatgpt-o1-previewがリリース\">ChatGPT o1-previewがリリース</h2>\n<p>o1-previewがリリースされ使えるようになりました。\nこれまでのChatGPT o4と比較すると、より深い思考を行い人間のように時間をかけて考える点が異なります。思考プロセスを洗練し、異なる戦略を試しミスを認識します。GPT-4oよりも複雑なタスクを推論し、科学、コーディング、数学の分野でより難しい問題を解決可能とされています。</p>\n<p>試してみたところ、必ずしもChatGPT o4よりも精度が高いとは限らないようです。一般的な言語タスクや幅広い知識を要する課題では素早く対応できるChatGPT o4の方が良い結果となることが多かったです。o1-previewの場合複数のステップで回答を検討していることが示され、時間がかかります。</p>\n<p>科学的モデリングや数学的分析は私は馴染みがありませんが、私の利用範囲で言うと課題を与えてプログラムコードを生成させるようなコーディングタスクでは o1-previewの方が良い結果になることが多いように思いました。</p>\n<p>活用分野により使い分けが必要ですが、従来モデルでは解決できない分野への適用の可能性が広がる点は素晴らしいと思います。</p>\n<h2 id=\"今更ながらamazon-q-developerを試す\">今更ながらAmazon Q Developerを試す</h2>\n<p>8月に発表されたGartner Magic Quadrant for AI Code Assistants\nについて日本語に記事が出始めました。各社が引用して自社のAIコードアシスタントをアピールしており、\nAWSの\n<a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/jp/blogs/news/aws-named-as-a-leader-in-the-first-gartner-magic-quadrant-for-ai-code-assistants/\">ブログ記事</a> でもその様子が見られます。</p>\n<p>この分野でリードしているのはやはりGitHub Copilotです。Google CloudのGemini Code AssistやGitLabのDuoなども追いかけています。</p>\n<p>AAWSも取り上げられていますが、Cloud9など一部のサービスが新規利用不可になっている中で「今更CodeWhisper？」と思いました。しかし、4月末からCodeWhisperはAmazon Q Developerに統合されていたことを思い出しました。対応しているIDEはVisual Studio Code、IntelliJ IDEA、AWS Cloud9ですが、私が使っているNeoVimはサポートされていません。しかし、Amazon Q Developerは\n<a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ja_jp/amazonq/latest/qdeveloper-ug/command-line-getting-started-installing.html\">Macのコマンドラインをサポート</a>しており、iTerm2、macOS ターミナル、Hyper、Alacritty、Kitty、wezTermと主なターミナルに対応しています。</p>\n<p>試していなかったので、Macに導入してみました。</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>CLI Completions</strong><br>\nシェルでコマンド補完ができる機能です。オンにするだけで、コマンドのオプションや引数、ファイル名などを賢く補完してくれます。非常に便利です。</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Chat</strong><br>\n<code>q chat</code>で開始できます。コマンド履歴やGitの状態を渡して「Gitのコンフリクトをどう解消する？」などと尋ねると、解決方法を解説してくれます。ただし、英語のみの対応です。</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Translate</strong><br>\n<code>q translate</code>で起動し、英語でやりたいことを入力すると、対応するコマンドに変換してくれます。例えば、<code>go to Desktop folder</code>と入力すると、<code>cd ~/Desktop</code>というコマンドを生成して実行するか確認してくれます。便利なのかは微妙です。</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>私が使用しているNeoVimには対応していないため、コーディングのアシストには使えませんが、コマンドラインの補完機能は割と便利なので利用しています。ちなみに、NeoVim上でのコードアシストにはCodeiumを使っています。</p>\n<h2 id=\"個人のタスク管理について\">個人のタスク管理について</h2>\n<p>個人のタスク管理で<a href=\"https://www.rememberthemilk.com/\">Remember The Milk</a>を15年ぶりに使い始めました。</p>\n<p>GTD<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup> が流行り出した頃 <a href=\"https://www.rememberthemilk.com/\">Remember The Milk</a>を使っていましたが、徐々に物足りなくなり以下のツールへと変遷してきました。</p>\n<ul>\n<li>本格的なGTDツールとして<a href=\"https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/\">OmniFocus</a>をしばらく使いましたが、GTDに忠実過ぎて使い勝手が悪くなりやめました。</li>\n<li>次にローカルでプレーンテキスト管理ができる<a href=\"https://www.taskpaper.com/\">Taskpaper</a>をしばらく試しました。コンセプトは素晴らしいものの、ファイル名を指定してタスクファイルを開いたり保存する操作が面倒でやめてしまいました。</li>\n<li>最終的にブラウザベースの<a href=\"https://www.toodledo.com/\">Toodledo</a>を長期間使用しました。柔軟なツールで、非常に使いやすかったです。</li>\n</ul>\n<p>今はプロジェクト管理をすることもなくプライベートなタスクを管理できれば良いのでシンプルなツールが良いと感じ、<a href=\"https://www.rememberthemilk.com/\">Remember The Milk</a>を再び使い始めました。初期のGTDコンセプトをベースにしたサービスですが、今でも優れた機能を提供しています。GTDを柔軟に、ルーズにも厳格にも運用できる点が魅力です。特に気に入っている点は以下です。</p>\n<ul>\n<li>不要なものを視界から排除したシンプルなユーザーインターフェイス</li>\n<li>多くのショートカットがより、慣れるとマウスなしで操作できる</li>\n<li>テキストだけでスマートなタスク登録が可能。「新店舗取材 ^Friday ~Sunday =1hour #weblog」と入力すると、開始日が金曜日、期限が日曜日、1時間程度のweblog関連タスクとして登録されます。</li>\n</ul>\n<p>また、CalDavを利用して完了日をイベントとして取得し、Fastmailのカレンダーでタスク期限を確認しています。</p>\n<p>無料版でも十分ですが、サービスへの支援としてPro版に移行しました。</p>\n<section

				"content_text": "今週は残暑にやられてしまし、体調を崩してしまいました。\r\n\r\n今週の気になった記事や出来事は次の4つです。\r\n\r\n- フジテレビ「牛の屠殺」発言について\r\n- CharGPT o1-previewがリリース\r\n- 今更ながらAmazon Q Developerを試す\r\n- 個人のタスク管理について\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## フジテレビ、「牛の屠殺」発言について\r\n\r\n\r\n9月12日の情報番組「ぽかぽか」で高畑淳子さんが通院した病院の対応　を「牛の屠殺みたいに」と表現しました。これに対して、フジテレビは「職業差別を助長する恐れがある不適切な表現」として、翌日の番組内で発言の取り消しと謝罪を行いました。\r\n\r\n\r\n遡ると1989年には、TBSの「NEWS21」で故・筑紫哲也氏が、麻薬問題で荒れるニューヨークを「残酷な殺し合いの場」として「屠殺場」という言葉を使用し、批判を受けたことがありました。全芝浦屠場労組と全横浜屠場労組がこれに抗議し、筑紫氏は約1年かけて彼らと議論し、自身の発言の差別性を明らかにした上で謝罪しました。\r\n\r\n\r\n「屠殺」という言葉の使用が差別的であったか考えてみましょう。「屠殺」を推奨される「食肉処理」に置き換えると、そのニュアンスがわかりやすくなります。\r\n\r\n筑紫氏の発言では、「残酷な殺し合い＝食肉処理」となり、問題があります。一方、高畑さんの場合、「流れ作業的＝食肉処理」との例えです。これは的確とは言えないものの、差別的な要素があるかは疑問です。一般的に「流れ作業的」なことを工場の「ベルトコンベア」に例えることがありますが、「食肉センター」が合理的で効率的であると指摘することは差別的なのでしょうか。\r\n\r\n\r\n私は問題なのはフジテレビの対応にあると思っています。主に2点です。\r\n\r\n- 筑紫氏のようにその意図の確認や検証の過程を明らかにせず、「職業差別を助長する恐れがある不適切発言」と断定したこと。\r\n- 発言者である高畑さんが不在の中で、フジテレビが謝罪したこと。\r\n\r\nこれでは、フジテレビが言葉狩りを行い、出演者を「差別的」と断罪し、一方的に謝罪を発信したように見えます。\r\n\r\n\r\n「屠殺」という言葉は古くは757年に施行された「養老律令」でも使用されています。「謂。元謀屠殺、其計已成、身雖不行、仍為首罪合斬」（屠殺を計画し、その計画が成立していれば、自ら行動しなくても首謀者として斬刑に処されるべきである）とあります。このように、「屠殺」とは単に「殺す」という意味であり、差別的なニュアンスは含まれてません。現に隣国の中国でも韓国でも用語として「屠殺」が普通に使用されています。\r\n\r\n\r\nさらに日本の「畜産物衛生管理法」第7条にて「（家畜の**屠殺**等）①家畜の**屠殺**・処理、集油、畜産物の加工・包装及び保管は、第22条第1項により許可を受けた作業場でしなければならない。 」と明記されています。一般的な用語であることがわかります。\r\n\r\n\r\n報道機関などでよく参照される共同通信社の『記者ハンドブック』では「屠殺」は「食肉処理」への言い換えが奨励されいます。差別的な概念を含まず歴史があり隣国も使用し日本でも法令が使用する言葉をなぜか封じ込めようとする。\r\n\r\nバカな話です。\r\n\r\n## ChatGPT o1-previewがリリース\r\n\r\no1-previewがリリースされ使えるようになりました。\r\nこれまでのChatGPT o4と比較すると、より深い思考を行い人間のように時間をかけて考える点が異なります。思考プロセスを洗練し、異なる戦略を試しミスを認識します。GPT-4oよりも複雑なタスクを推論し、科学、コーディング、数学の分野でより難しい問題を解決可能とされています。\r\n\r\n試してみたところ、必ずしもChatGPT o4よりも精度が高いとは限らないようです。一般的な言語タスクや幅広い知識を要する課題では素早く対応できるChatGPT o4の方が良い結果となることが多かったです。o1-previewの場合複数のステップで回答を検討していることが示され、時間がかかります。\r\n\r\n科学的モデリングや数学的分析は私は馴染みがありませんが、私の利用範囲で言うと課題を与えてプログラムコードを生成させるようなコーディングタスクでは o1-previewの方が良い結果になることが多いように思いました。\r\n\r\n活用分野により使い分けが必要ですが、従来モデルでは解決できない分野への適用の可能性が広がる点は素晴らしいと思います。\r\n\r\n## 今更ながらAmazon Q Developerを試す\r\n\r\n\r\n8月に発表されたGartner Magic Quadrant for AI Code Assistants\r\nについて日本語に記事が出始めました。各社が引用して自社のAIコードアシスタントをアピールしており、\r\nAWSの\r\n[ブログ記事](https://aws.amazon.com/jp/blogs/news/aws-named-as-a-leader-in-the-first-gartner-magic-quadrant-for-ai-code-assistants/) でもその様子が見られます。\r\n\r\nこの分野でリードしているのはやはりGitHub Copilotです。Google CloudのGemini Code AssistやGitLabのDuoなども追いかけています。\r\n\r\nAAWSも取り上げられていますが、Cloud9など一部のサービスが新規利用不可になっている中で「今更CodeWhisper？」と思いました。しかし、4月末からCodeWhisperはAmazon Q Developerに統合されていたことを思い出しました。対応しているIDEはVisual Studio Code、IntelliJ IDEA、AWS Cloud9ですが、私が使っているNeoVimはサポートされていません。しかし、Amazon Q Developerは\r\n[Macのコマンドラインをサポート](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ja_jp/amazonq/latest/qdeveloper-ug/command-line-getting-started-installing.html)しており、iTerm2、macOS ターミナル、Hyper、Alacritty、Kitty、wezTermと主なターミナルに対応しています。\r\n\r\n\r\n試していなかったので、Macに導入してみました。\r\n\r\n\r\n- **CLI Completions**  \r\n  シェルでコマンド補完ができる機能です。オンにするだけで、コマンドのオプションや引数、ファイル名などを賢く補完してくれます。非常に便利です。\r\n  \r\n- **Chat**  \r\n  `q chat`で開始できます。コマンド履歴やGitの状態を渡して「Gitのコンフリクトをどう解消する？」などと尋ねると、解決方法を解説してくれます。ただし、英語のみの対応です。\r\n  \r\n- **Translate**  \r\n  `q translate`で起動し、英語でやりたいことを入力すると、対応するコマンドに変換してくれます。例えば、`go to Desktop folder`と入力すると、`cd ~/Desktop`というコマンドを生成して実行するか確認してくれます。便利なのかは微妙です。\r\n\r\n\r\n私が使用しているNeoVimには対応していないため、コーディングのアシストには使えませんが、コマンドラインの補完機能は割と便利なので利用しています。ちなみに、NeoVim上でのコードアシストにはCodeiumを使っています。\r\n\r\n\r\n## 個人のタスク管理について\r\n\r\n個人のタスク管理で[Remember The Milk](https://www.rememberthemilk.com/)を15年ぶりに使い始めました。\r\n\r\nGTD[^1] が流行り出した頃 [Remember The Milk](https://www.rememberthemilk.com/)を使っていましたが、徐々に物足りなくなり以下のツールへと変遷してきました。\r\n\r\n\r\n- 本格的なGTDツールとして[OmniFocus](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/)をしばらく使いましたが、GTDに忠実過ぎて使い勝手が悪くなりやめました。\r\n- 次にローカルでプレーンテキスト管理ができる[Taskpaper](https://www.taskpaper.com/)をしばらく試しました。コンセプトは素晴らしいものの、ファイル名を指定してタスクファイルを開いたり保存する操作が面倒でやめてしまいました。\r\n- 最終的にブラウザベースの[Toodledo](https://www.toodledo.com/)を長期間使用しました。柔軟なツールで、非常に使いやすかったです。\r\n\r\n今はプロジェクト管理をすることもなくプライベートなタスクを管理できれば良いのでシンプルなツールが良いと感じ、[Remember The Milk](https://www.rememberthemilk.com/)を再び使い始めました。初期のGTDコンセプトをベースにしたサービスですが、今でも優れた機能を提供しています。GTDを柔軟に、ルーズにも厳格にも運用できる点が魅力です。特に気に入っている点は以下です。\r\n\r\n- 不要なものを視界から排除したシンプルなユーザーインターフェイス\r\n- 多くのショートカットがより、慣れるとマウスなしで操作できる\r\n- テキストだけでスマートなタスク登録が可能。「新店舗取材 ^Friday ~Sunday =1hour #weblog」と入力すると、開始日が金曜日、期限が日曜日、1時間程度のweblog関連タスクとして登録されます。\r\n\r\nまた、CalDavを利用して完了日をイベントとして取得し、Fastmailのカレンダーでタスク期限を確認しています。\r\n\r\n無料版でも十分ですが、サービスへの支援としてPro版に移行しました。\r\n\r\n\r\n[^1]: 「Getting Things Done」の略で、デビッド・アレンによって提唱されたタスク管理や生産性向上のためのメソッド。\r\n\r\n\r\n",

				"content_text": "今週の気になった記事や出来事は次の4つです。\n\n- NVIDIA株価下落と米国経済\n- Telegram CEOのフランス政府による逮捕\n- 史上最強クラス 台風10号上陸\n- 採譜ソフトウェアの定番 Finaleのフィナーレ\n\n<!--more-->\n\n## NVIDIA株価下落と米国経済\n\n米国時間8/28の市場閉場後に注目されていたNVIDIAの株価ですが、時間外取引で6％程度\n下落しました。Magnificent7の中でも急成長しているNVIDIAの株価下落は、今後の米国\n経済の悪化の予兆のような論調もありますが、私自身は楽観しています。\n\n\n決済自体は売上は予想を上回り過去1年で122%の成長を遂げており、確かに成長自体は鈍\n化していますが、利益率は高い水準を維持しています。むしろ投資家のNVIDIAに対する\n期待が高すぎた状態であったのが、調整が入ったと見ています。\n\n\nまた、Magnificent7が米国の成長を牽引しているとも言われますが、NVIDIAの株価と\nS&P500の動きはそこまで相関があったわけでもありません。株価は下落したものの、ビ\nジネス自体は成長しており、AIを中心としたエコシステムが崩壊するような状況でもあ\nりません。\n\t\n9月には利上げが予想されるので、10月くらいまでは上昇相場を期待できるのではないかと思います。\n\t\n## Telegram CEOのフランス政府による逮捕\n\n\nパヴェル・ドゥーロフCEOは2024年8月24日に、パリ郊外のル・ブルジェ空港で逮捕されました。プライベートジェットで着陸してきたところを滑走路上で逮捕されたというのでかなり異例な状況だったのではないでしょうか？\n\n\n容疑は「Telegramアプリを通じて行われている麻薬密売・マネーロンダリング・児童ポルノといった犯罪行為の共犯」ということですが、気になった点が3つありました。\n\n\nまず第一に「これはフランス版Winny事件か？」と思いました。Telegramというメッセージアプリは確かにテロ組織で使われていると言われています。まだ詳細が不明なのでなんとも言えませんが、Telegramというプラットフォームを提供しているだけで「共犯」とされているのであれば、とんでもないことです。正に日本のWinny事件の二の舞いになりかねません。\n\n\n第二にフランスという国のスタンスです。UAE国籍だったドゥーロフCEOにフランスのマクロン大統領が2018年のランチミーティングでTelgram本社のパリ移転と国籍付与を提案して、2021年に国籍取得という経緯を見るとズブズブだと思っていたのですが、今回のこの逮捕はなんなのでしょう。\n\n\n第三にフランスとUAEがドゥーロフCEOのiPhoneをハッキングしていたという話もあります。Telegramは暗号化に強いというイメージがありますが、E2Eの暗号化をしていないので穴だらけです。さもありなんという印象です。\n\t\n以下はよく比較されるメッセージングアプリの比較です。\n\n\n| Provider  | オープンソース | E2E暗号化| セキュリティ監査 | 暗号化されたビデオ通話 | Anonymous |\n|-----------|-------------|----------------|-----------------|------------------------|-----------|\n| Signal    | ✔️          | ✔️             | ✔️              | ✔️                     | ✔️        |\n| Threema   | ✔️          | ✔️             | ✔️              | ✔️                     | ✔️        |\n| Telegram  | ✔️          | ❌             | ❌              | ✔️                     | ✔️        |\n\t\nこう見るとTelgramは暗号化もE2Eではされておらず、本当にテロ組織が使っているかと怪しく思います。\n\n\nちなみに私はスイス産のThreemaをメインで使用しています。\n\n\n## 史上最強クラス 台風10号上陸\n\n\n今週は水曜から史上最強クラスと言われる台風10号(ShanShan)が九州に上陸し、週明けにかけて日本列島を縦断していきそうです。歩みの遅い台風でなので、いつ両親の住む地域や私の住む関東に近づいてくるか神経質なくらいチェックしてしまいます。\n\n\n気象庁やWeatherNewsのサイトではなかなか思った情報がタイムリーに得られないこともあるので、気象情報を提供するサイトをいくつか試してみました。気に入ったのはWindy.comとVentuskyです。\n\n\nどちらもチェコ発のサービスですが、どちらも予報に特化しておらず詳細な気象情報をビジュアルなグラフィックで提供してくれる点が一方的な情報を垂れ流してくる日本の気象ニュースと違って私のニーズにあっています。またグローバルの予報モデルを複数サポートしている点が気象庁情報に大きく依存している日本のサイトよりも気に入っています。\n\n\nどちらも機能的には拮抗しているように思いますが、次の3点からWindy.comを使用しています。\n1. Windy.comにはタイフーントラッカーという台風に特化したメニューがある\n2. Windy.comは今年から気象庁モデルにも対応を開始した\n3. Ventuskyの有料サービスはGoogle/Apple経由でしか購入できないが、Windy.comはクレジットカードやPayPal経由で支払いができる。\n\n\n台風進路など気象庁モデルとヨーロッパのECMWFでは結構違うので参考にあります。有料サービスを購入すると1時間のメッシュで細かい予報も見れるので普段の生活でも役立ちそうです。\n\n\nビジュアルにアニメーションもついているので、スクリーンセーバー的に眺めていても飽きることがありません。\n\t\n\t\n## 採譜ソフトウェアの定番 Finaleのフィナーレ\n\n\n採譜ソフトウェアの定番 Finaleが開発・販売を中止することが発表され､採譜の世界で\nはデファクトスタンダードだったので業界は混乱しているようです。\n\n\n曲の配布や演奏に「採譜」というプロセスが必要だった時代から、作曲過程からデジタ\nル化され演奏まで直結できる現代において「採譜」の占める役割が大きく変わっていま\nす。デジタル化されているので作曲データをそのまま採譜として利用することも可能で\nす。\n\n\nだからこそ「採譜」という領域にこだわって突き詰めたFinaleは存在価値があったので\nすが、採譜自体のニーズの低下に伴い他のソフトウェアの採譜機能で十分という状況は\n必然でしたね。\n\n",

The review reads: The first three of a limited six part series exploring Japanese listening cafes/bars, with classical, Jazz and J-Rock covered. The episodes show the commitment to the listening experience, with the classical cafe no longer serving food so the noise didn’t distract from the music. The owners have spent a lifetime (or in the case of the classical one nearly 100 years by multiple generations of the family) building their record collections and personalising the audio equipment and even making their own speakers to suit the space. Each episode covers a part of Japanese history from the 1930s to the ‘90s through personal reflections of the owners and visitors, their passion for the music clearly evident. The storytelling with the music background was so intimate and almost reverent, you wanted to be in the bar sharing a drink with the owner.\" loading=\"lazy\">\r\n<footer>Peter Wickins <cite><a href=\"https://journal.meandering.space/2024/08/25/miff-number-was.html\" class=\"u-in-reply-to\">https://journal.meandering.space/2024/08/25/miff-number-was.html</a></cite></footer></blockquote><script src=\"https://cdn.micro.blog/quoteback.js\"></script>\n",

How do I go build something that's interesting\n> for my end users to use?\n>\n> 今から24か月後、またはある一定の期間を経た時点で、ほとんどの開発者がコーディ\n> ングをしていない可能性があります。コーディングは、ただコンピュータとやり取り\n> するための言語にすぎません。それ自体が必ずしもスキルというわけではありませ\n> ん。スキルそのものは、「どうやって革新を起こすか」、「エンドユーザーが使って\n> 面白いものをどう作るか」といったことです。\n>\n> Business Insider- <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/aws-ceo-developers-stop-coding-ai-takes-over-2024-8\">In a leaked recording, Amazon cloud chief tells employees that most developers could stop coding soon as AI takes over</a>\n\n\nイノベーション志向の会社のCEOらしい発言ですが、\n経営工学を学びインターンでアマゾンに入社しAWSの技術チームを率いた後に\n営業とマーケティングを経験していても、事業会社でのIT経験がないCEOらしい狭量な発言です。\n\n\n人間が作成したアルゴリズムを使わずニューラルネットでシステムを作成すると言う[Software2.0](https://karpathy.medium.com/software-2-0-a64152b37c35)は、最先端でも理解しているエンジニアもほとんどいないため実案件で使われるようになるには少し時間が掛かるでしょう。\n\n\n[以前の記事](https://blog.yostos.org/2024/08/09/software-development-using.html)で書いたよう、当面はCopliotのようなAIの補完ツール、Anthropic社の[Cloude3 Sonnet Artifacts]のようなAIと協働して開発を進めるモデルを経てAIにアルゴリズムを開発させる形態へと徐々に移行していくでしょう。\n\n\nこの文脈でAIが活用されている間は最終的な成果物の評価はエンジニアに委ねられるため、\nこれまで以上に高度なコーディングスキルが求められるでしょう。\nむしろ独自に開発する機会が減る分、エンジニアが実践的なコーディングスキルを\n養うことが難しくなるかもしれません。\n\n\nそれでも、探求心のあるエンジニアは仕事以外でもコーディングを続け、スキルを高めていけるでしょう。一方で、エンジニアという職業についているだけの多くの人はこれまで通り能力を発揮できないでしょう。\n\n\n## 一連の誹謗中傷事件について\n\n\nここ最近、お笑い芸人フワちゃんによる、X（旧ツイッター）上でのやす子への不適切発言や\n重定知佳選手の事件、SNSでの五輪アスリートへの攻撃など誹謗中傷について事件が目立った\nように思います。\n\n\nまた、これらの事件に対する報道や世間の味方も気になりました。\n\n\n### 人間の本性\n\n\n少し前に読んだ橘玲氏の『[世界はなぜ地獄になるのか](https://amzn.to/474Lm1M)』が、\nこういった事象に関する人間の本性を見事に言い当てています。\n\n\n要約すると、次のようなものです。\n\n\n- 旧石器時代の数百万年間、人類は150人程度共同体の中で生きるよう適応してきた。\n- 共同体の中での競争はステイタスゲームとして行われ、ステイタスが下がる=共同体からの排除を意味し、正に死活問題であった。\n- ステイタスを上げるには成功、支配、美徳と3つの戦略があるが、前者2つは支配者や金持ちにしか実現が難しく、美徳は「道徳律の実践」により得られるものなので、本来はいずれもリスクとコストを伴うものであった。\n- ただし「美徳」には道徳律実践以外に「不道徳者を暴き出し\"正義\"を振りかざして叩く」ことで自身の道徳的地位を相対的に引き上げて美徳を固辞する戦略が存在する。\n\n\nこうして、成功ゲームや支配ゲームをうまくプレイできない落ちこぼれが、\n「被害者」を見つけては正義の元に他者を糾弾する美徳ゲームになだれ込むことになります。\n中世の異端審問を始め、フランス革命期の恐怖政治、南北線戦争後のレコンストラクション、\nマッカーシズムなど、歴史を振り返っても美徳ゲームに熱狂していた大衆の姿をすぐに見つける\nことができます。\n\n\n社会的、経済的な地位に関係なく誰でも出来る美徳ゲームは、インターネット、SNSを通じて、\n更に匿名でローリスク、ローコストで行うことが可能となりました。\n\n\n誹謗・中傷やキャンセル・カルチャーは、こういった人類の社会的・生物学的な背景から\n見ると大半の人類の本性であり、これからも多くの人がこの「正義というエンターテイメント」\nを存分に楽しんでいくでしょう。\n\n\n### キャンセル・カルチャー時代を生き抜く\n\n\nキャンセル・カルチャーや誹謗中傷が人類の本性だとすると、あなたがネットで出会う大半の相手は\n落ちこぼれブレーキが外れた正義エンターテイメントに勤しんでいる輩です。\n\n\nこういった状況から身を守るには、次の3つの戦略しかありません。\n\n\n- 「関わらない」 つまり、こういった輩が多数存在し自身でコミュニケーションをコントロールできない中央集権的なSNSプラットフォームから撤退する。\n- 「正義である」自身への抑制のためにも、匿名でなく実名でフェアネスな立場で発言していることを常に明確にする。\n- 「潜伏する」自身も人間なのでどこかで正義エンターテイメントに身を任せ問題発言をしてしまうことは避けられないでしょう。そのため、徹底的に潜み匿名に徹しましょう。発信者情報開示請求されても身バレしない対処をちゃんとやっておきましょう。\n\n\n私自身は、すべてのSNSを一旦削除し、実名でこのサイトを運営し、個人でVPNや暗号化を徹底しています。\n\n",

I decided to summarize my\nthoughts here. 🪄</p>\n<p>最近ChatGPTを使ったソフトウェア開発について人と話したときに気になったことがあるので、思った事まとめておこうと思います。</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<h2 id=\"dramatic-cost-reduction\">Dramatic Cost Reduction</h2>\n<p>The use of generative AI has dramatically reduced the costs of producing images\nand music. For example, tasks like illustration creation (using services like\nMidjourney and DALL-E 2) and music creation (using services like Udio and Suno),\nwhich previously required specialists, can now be done by individuals in about\nfive minutes using generative AI-powered services.</p>\n<p>In software development, the use of generative AI for development support is\nalso spreading. Many developers are likely using tools like Github Copilot.</p>\n<p>However, applications of generative AI in software development are progressing\nbeyond mere coding support. For example, I recently changed the static site\ngenerator for my main blog, which required converting the metadata of several\nhundred articles. I wrote a conversion program in Python, but by providing\nChatGPT with the prerequisites and requirements, I only needed to make about 10%\nmodifications to the generated code.</p>\n<p>This example shows that generative AI can shoulder not only development support\nbut also the creation of software itself, similar to image and music\nproduction. In the example above, what would have taken about two weeks if\noutsourced to a development vendor was reduced to about 30 minutes of work\nusing generative AI.</p>\n<p>The cost is only 0.6%.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-generative-ai-software-development-brings\">What Generative AI Software Development Brings</h2>\n<p>The rationale for traditional software development was that it could reduce the\nworkload of many people through repeated use. Therefore, single-use software\ndevelopment for specific users was not permitted.</p>\n<p>However, there is a world where single-use software development has been\nallowed: the realm of data science. This is because of the unique nature of\ndatasets and the need for trial and error, where speed is prioritized over\nreuse. The most significant reason is that the benefits gained from single-use\nsoftware development outweigh the costs.</p>\n<p>By leveraging generative AI, it becomes possible to reduce costs in general\nsoftware development similarly. This means that even single-use software\ndevelopment for one user, which does not contribute to reducing the workload of\nmany, becomes feasible.</p>\n<p>In other words, we are entering an era where problems that could be solved by\nsoftware but were left unaddressed due to development costs can now be resolved\nquickly using generative AI for software development.</p>\n<p>In practice, when you ask ChatGPT a question like &ldquo;What is the date 100 days\nafter August 9, 2024?&rdquo;, the following single-use Python code, specialized for\nthis problem, is generated and executed behind the scenes:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4\"><code class=\"language-python\" data-lang=\"python\"><span style=\"color:#f92672\">from</span> datetime <span style=\"color:#f92672\">import</span> datetime, timedelta\n\n<span style=\"color:#75715e\"># Starting date</span>\nstart_date <span style=\"color:#f92672\">=</span> datetime(<span style=\"color:#ae81ff\">2024</span>, <span style=\"color:#ae81ff\">8</span>, <span style=\"color:#ae81ff\">8</span>)\n\n<span style=\"color:#75715e\"># Calculate the date 100 days later</span>\nend_date <span style=\"color:#f92672\">=</span> start_date <span style=\"color:#f92672\">+</span> timedelta(days<span style=\"color:#f92672\">=</span><span style=\"color:#ae81ff\">100</span>)\nend_date<span style=\"color:#f92672\">.</span>strftime(<span style=\"color:#e6db74\">&#39;%Y-%m-</span><span style=\"color:#e6db74\">%d</span><span style=\"color:#e6db74\">&#39;</span>)\n</code></pre></div><h2 id=\"differences-from-rpa-and-no-code\">Differences from RPA and No-Code</h2>\n<p>Similar technologies include RPA and no-code solutions. Many companies have\nadopted these technologies, riding the wave of the DX trend.</p>\n<p>Both have the effect of lowering software development costs, but there are\nsignificant differences in their technology and implementation effects.</p>\n<p>From a technical perspective, while generative AI software development involves\ncustom development by AI according to requirements, RPA and no-code solutions\nappear to meet user requests but, in reality, only pour parameters into\npre-made software provided by vendors. Therefore, what can be achieved must be\nbased on the templates of the pre-made software.</p>\n<p>More importantly than these technical differences is the impact of their\nimplementation. In many cases with RPA and no-code solutions, user departments,\nfrustrated with waiting in line for the development department&rsquo;s backlog,\ndevelop the software themselves. This means that non-developers are creating\nreusable software, or corporate software assets, which is a nightmare. Years\nlater, the software will likely become a maintenance burden due to the users'\ntransfer or the vendors' product lifecycle.</p>\n<p>In contrast, single-use software development using generative AI emphasizes the\noutcomes rather than the software itself. Thus, the specifics of the software\ndo not matter. Even so, a verifiable artifact in the form of &ldquo;source code&rdquo; is\ncreated, making it a completely transparent process (white box).</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Seeing companies that claim to have achieved &ldquo;DX&rdquo; by introducing RPA and\nno-code solutions gives me chills. In contrast, companies should recognize the\nnew application methods of software development, where generative AI can be\nused to solve problems on the spot, similar to the approach taken by data\nscientists.</p>\n<p>In such a world, engineers with the ability to read source code will become\nincreasingly necessary. Companies currently investing in RPA and no-code\nsolutions should be cautious, as they may be going against the trend.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"劇的なコスト削減\">劇的なコスト削減</h2>\n<p>生成系AIの活用により、画像や音楽の制作コストが劇的に削減されています。例えば、\nこれまで専門家に依頼しなければならなかったイラスト作成（MidjourneyやDALL-E 2な\nど）や音楽作成（UdioやSunoなど）を、生成系AIを取り入れたサービスを使うことで、\n自分で5分ほどで望みの画像や音楽を制作することができます。</p>\n<p>ソフトウェア開発においても、生成系AIを活用した開発支援が広がってきています。実\n際に、Github Copilotのようなツールを使用している開発者も多いでしょう。</p>\n<p>しかし、これらのコーディング支援とは別の次元で、ソフトウェア開発への応用も進ん\nでいます。例えば、最近私はメインブログの静的サイトジェネレータを変更しました\nが、それに伴い記事のメタデータの変換が必要でした。数百ある記事の変換プログラム\nをPythonで書きましたが、ChatGPTに前提と要件を伝えて生成されたコードをベースに、\n10%程度の修正を行うだけで済みました。</p>\n<p>これは、開発作業の支援だけでなく、画像や音楽の制作と同様にソフトウェア制作その\nものを生成系AIに肩代わりさせることができる例です。上記の例では、開発ベンダーに\n依頼すると2週間ほどの時間がかかるところを、生成系AIを使って自分でコードを作成す\nれば30分程度で済みます。</p>\n<p>コストは0.6%で済んでしまいます。</p>\n<h2 id=\"生成系aiによるソフトウェア開発がもたらすもの\">生成系AIによるソフトウェア開発がもたらすもの</h2>\n<p>従来のソフトウェア開発のRationale（根拠）は、何度も使用されることで多くの人の作\n業を軽減できることにありました。そのため、特定のユーザーのための使い切りのソフ\nトウェア開発は許されませんでした。</p>\n<p>しかし、使い切りのソフトウェア開発が許されてきた世界があります。それはデータサ\nイエンスの領域です。これは、データセットの特異性やそれに伴う試行錯誤の必要性、\n再利用より迅速性が重視されたためです。最も大きな理由は、使い切りのソフトウェア\n開発のコストに対して得られる成果が大きいからです。</p>\n<p>生成系AIを活用すれば、一般的なソフトウェア開発でも同様にコスト削減が可能とな\nり、多くの人の作業軽減に貢献しない、一人のユーザーのためだけの使い切りのソフト\nウェア開発を行うことも可能になります。</p>\n<p>つまり、これまで開発コストを理由にソフトウェアで解決出来る問題が放置されていた\n状況を「生成系AI使って、ささっとソフトウェア開発をして解決すればよい」という時\n代になってきていると感じます。</p>\n<p>実際、ChatGPTで「2024年8月9日の100日後は何日？」というような質問の回答を作るの\nに、裏では以下のようはこの問題に特化した使い切りのPythonコードが生成されて実行\nされています。</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4\"><code class=\"language-python\" data-lang=\"python\"><span style=\"color:#f92672\">from</span> datetime <span style=\"color:#f92672\">import</span> datetime, timedelta\n\n<span style=\"color:#75715e\"># Starting date</span>\nstart_date <span style=\"color:#f92672\">=</span> datetime(<span style=\"color:#ae81ff\">2024</span>, <span style=\"color:#ae81ff\">8</span>, <span style=\"color:#ae81ff\">8</span>)\n\n<span style=\"color:#75715e\"># Calculate the date 100 days later</span>\nend_date <span style=\"color:#f92672\">=</span> start_date <span style=\"color:#f92672\">+</span> timedelta(days<span style=\"color:#f92672\">=</span><span style=\"color:#ae81ff\">100</span>)\nend_date<span style=\"color:#f92672\">.</span>strftime(<span style=\"color:#e6db74\">&#39;%Y-%m-</span><span style=\"color:#e6db74\">%d</span><span style=\"color:#e6db74\">&#39;</span>)\n</code></pre></div><h2 id=\"rpaやノーコードとの違い\">RPAやノーコードとの違い</h2>\n<p>似たような技術にはRPAやノーコードがあります。DXの流行に乗って、これらを導入した\n企業も多いと思います。</p>\n<p>どちらもソフトウェア開発コストを下げるという効果がありますが、その技術と導入効\n果の面で大きな違いがあります。</p>\n<p>技術面で見ると、生成系AIによるソフトウェア開発では要件に従いAIよるソフトウェア\nのカスタム開発が行われていますが、RPAやノーコードではユーザーのリクエストに沿っ\nて必要なソフトウェアを実現しているように見えますが、実際にはベンダーが用意した\nソフトウェアにパラメータを流し込んでいるだけです。そのため、実現できることもあ\nらかじめ用意されたソフトウェアのひな形に沿った要件に落とし込む必要があります。</p>\n<p>こういった技術的な違いよりも、問題はその導入効果です。\nRPAやノーコードで多く行われているのは、開発部門のバックログの列に並ぶことに業を\n煮やしたユーザー部門が自身で開発を行うというパターンです。これは使い回すソフト\nウェア、つまり企業のソフトウェア資産を開発者でない素人が開発してしまうことを意\n味します。悪夢でしかありません。数年後には開発したユーザーの異動やベンダーの製\n品ライフサイクルから、メンテナンスできないソフトウェアという負の遺産になってい\nることでしょう<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup>。</p>\n<p>一方、生成系AIによる使い切りソフトウェア開発は、生成したソフトウェアそのもので\nはなく、その成果が重視されるため、どのようなソフトウェアだったかは問題になりま\nせん。それでも、「ソースコード」という検証可能な成果物が作成されるため、完全に\n透明な状態（ホワイトボックス）です。</p>\n<h2 id=\"まとめ\">まとめ</h2>\n<p>RPAやノーコードのソリューションを導入して「DX実現」としている企業の将来を思うと\n暗い未来しか想像できません。</p>\n<p>一方で従来のソフトウェア開発とは異なる、これまでデータサイエンティストが取り組\nんできたようなアプローチ、つまるソフトウェア開発によるその場の問題解決が生成系\nAIを使うと可能になるので、新しいソフトウェアの応用方法として企業はしっかりと認\n知すべきだと思います。</p>\n<p>こういった世界ではソースコードを読む能力を持ったエンジニアはますます必要になっ\nてくるので、そういった意味でもRPAやノーコードに取り組んでいる企業は逆流している\nので気をつけたほうがよいと思います。</p>\n<section class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:1\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n<p>「サーバー型RPAならば集中管理できてそうはならない」という意見もありますが、ならばIT部門が開発して管理すればよくベンダー依存のランタイム上でシステムを構築する意味はないのではないでしょうか？ もっともここにAIを応用すると世界が変わる可能性はありますが、現時点ではまだ予測不能です。&#160;<a href=\"#fnref:1\" class=\"footnote-backref\" role=\"doc-backlink\">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</section>",

In the example above, what would have taken about two weeks if\noutsourced to a development vendor was reduced to about 30 minutes of work\nusing generative AI.\n\nThe cost is only 0.6%.\n\n## What Generative AI Software Development Brings\n\nThe rationale for traditional software development was that it could reduce the\nworkload of many people through repeated use. Therefore, single-use software\ndevelopment for specific users was not permitted.\n\nHowever, there is a world where single-use software development has been\nallowed: the realm of data science. This is because of the unique nature of\ndatasets and the need for trial and error, where speed is prioritized over\nreuse. The most significant reason is that the benefits gained from single-use\nsoftware development outweigh the costs.\n\nBy leveraging generative AI, it becomes possible to reduce costs in general\nsoftware development similarly. This means that even single-use software\ndevelopment for one user, which does not contribute to reducing the workload of\nmany, becomes feasible.\n\nIn other words, we are entering an era where problems that could be solved by\nsoftware but were left unaddressed due to development costs can now be resolved\nquickly using generative AI for software development.\n\nIn practice, when you ask ChatGPT a question like \"What is the date 100 days\nafter August 9, 2024?\", the following single-use Python code, specialized for\nthis problem, is generated and executed behind the scenes:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\n# Starting date\nstart_date = datetime(2024, 8, 8)\n\n# Calculate the date 100 days later\nend_date = start_date + timedelta(days=100)\nend_date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')\n```\n\n## Differences from RPA and No-Code\n\nSimilar technologies include RPA and no-code solutions. Many companies have\nadopted these technologies, riding the wave of the DX trend.\n\nBoth have the effect of lowering software development costs, but there are\nsignificant differences in their technology and implementation effects.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, while generative AI software development involves\ncustom development by AI according to requirements, RPA and no-code solutions\nappear to meet user requests but, in reality, only pour parameters into\npre-made software provided by vendors. Therefore, what can be achieved must be\nbased on the templates of the pre-made software.\n\nMore importantly than these technical differences is the impact of their\nimplementation. In many cases with RPA and no-code solutions, user departments,\nfrustrated with waiting in line for the development department's backlog,\ndevelop the software themselves. This means that non-developers are creating\nreusable software, or corporate software assets, which is a nightmare. Years\nlater, the software will likely become a maintenance burden due to the users'\ntransfer or the vendors' product lifecycle.\n\nIn contrast, single-use software development using generative AI emphasizes the\noutcomes rather than the software itself. Thus, the specifics of the software\ndo not matter. Even so, a verifiable artifact in the form of \"source code\" is\ncreated, making it a completely transparent process (white box).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nSeeing companies that claim to have achieved \"DX\" by introducing RPA and\nno-code solutions gives me chills. In contrast, companies should recognize the\nnew application methods of software development, where generative AI can be\nused to solve problems on the spot, similar to the approach taken by data\nscientists.\n\nIn such a world, engineers with the ability to read source code will become\nincreasingly necessary. Companies currently investing in RPA and no-code\nsolutions should be cautious, as they may be going against the trend.\n\n---\n\n## 劇的なコスト削減\n\n生成系AIの活用により、画像や音楽の制作コストが劇的に削減されています。例えば、\nこれまで専門家に依頼しなければならなかったイラスト作成（MidjourneyやDALL-E 2な\nど）や音楽作成（UdioやSunoなど）を、生成系AIを取り入れたサービスを使うことで、\n自分で5分ほどで望みの画像や音楽を制作することができます。\n\nソフトウェア開発においても、生成系AIを活用した開発支援が広がってきています。実\n際に、Github Copilotのようなツールを使用している開発者も多いでしょう。\n\nしかし、これらのコーディング支援とは別の次元で、ソフトウェア開発への応用も進ん\nでいます。例えば、最近私はメインブログの静的サイトジェネレータを変更しました\nが、それに伴い記事のメタデータの変換が必要でした。数百ある記事の変換プログラム\nをPythonで書きましたが、ChatGPTに前提と要件を伝えて生成されたコードをベースに、\n10%程度の修正を行うだけで済みました。\n\nこれは、開発作業の支援だけでなく、画像や音楽の制作と同様にソフトウェア制作その\nものを生成系AIに肩代わりさせることができる例です。上記の例では、開発ベンダーに\n依頼すると2週間ほどの時間がかかるところを、生成系AIを使って自分でコードを作成す\nれば30分程度で済みます。\n\nコストは0.6%で済んでしまいます。\n\n## 生成系AIによるソフトウェア開発がもたらすもの\n\n従来のソフトウェア開発のRationale（根拠）は、何度も使用されることで多くの人の作\n業を軽減できることにありました。そのため、特定のユーザーのための使い切りのソフ\nトウェア開発は許されませんでした。\n\nしかし、使い切りのソフトウェア開発が許されてきた世界があります。それはデータサ\nイエンスの領域です。これは、データセットの特異性やそれに伴う試行錯誤の必要性、\n再利用より迅速性が重視されたためです。最も大きな理由は、使い切りのソフトウェア\n開発のコストに対して得られる成果が大きいからです。\n\n生成系AIを活用すれば、一般的なソフトウェア開発でも同様にコスト削減が可能とな\nり、多くの人の作業軽減に貢献しない、一人のユーザーのためだけの使い切りのソフト\nウェア開発を行うことも可能になります。\n\nつまり、これまで開発コストを理由にソフトウェアで解決出来る問題が放置されていた\n状況を「生成系AI使って、ささっとソフトウェア開発をして解決すればよい」という時\n代になってきていると感じます。\n\n実際、ChatGPTで「2024年8月9日の100日後は何日？」というような質問の回答を作るの\nに、裏では以下のようはこの問題に特化した使い切りのPythonコードが生成されて実行\nされています。\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\n# Starting date\nstart_date = datetime(2024, 8, 8)\n\n# Calculate the date 100 days later\nend_date = start_date + timedelta(days=100)\nend_date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')\n```\n\n## RPAやノーコードとの違い\n\n似たような技術にはRPAやノーコードがあります。DXの流行に乗って、これらを導入した\n企業も多いと思います。\n\nどちらもソフトウェア開発コストを下げるという効果がありますが、その技術と導入効\n果の面で大きな違いがあります。\n\n技術面で見ると、生成系AIによるソフトウェア開発では要件に従いAIよるソフトウェア\nのカスタム開発が行われていますが、RPAやノーコードではユーザーのリクエストに沿っ\nて必要なソフトウェアを実現しているように見えますが、実際にはベンダーが用意した\nソフトウェアにパラメータを流し込んでいるだけです。そのため、実現できることもあ\nらかじめ用意されたソフトウェアのひな形に沿った要件に落とし込む必要があります。\n\nこういった技術的な違いよりも、問題はその導入効果です。\nRPAやノーコードで多く行われているのは、開発部門のバックログの列に並ぶことに業を\n煮やしたユーザー部門が自身で開発を行うというパターンです。これは使い回すソフト\nウェア、つまり企業のソフトウェア資産を開発者でない素人が開発してしまうことを意\n味します。悪夢でしかありません。数年後には開発したユーザーの異動やベンダーの製\n品ライフサイクルから、メンテナンスできないソフトウェアという負の遺産になってい\nることでしょう[^1]。\n\n一方、生成系AIによる使い切りソフトウェア開発は、生成したソフトウェアそのもので\nはなく、その成果が重視されるため、どのようなソフトウェアだったかは問題になりま\nせん。それでも、「ソースコード」という検証可能な成果物が作成されるため、完全に\n透明な状態（ホワイトボックス）です。\n\n[^1]: 「サーバー型RPAならば集中管理できてそうはならない」という意見もありますが、ならばIT部門が開発して管理すればよくベンダー依存のランタイム上でシステムを構築する意味はないのではないでしょうか？ もっともここにAIを応用すると世界が変わる可能性はありますが、現時点ではまだ予測不能です。\n\n## まとめ\n\n\nRPAやノーコードのソリューションを導入して「DX実現」としている企業の将来を思うと\n暗い未来しか想像できません。\n\n一方で従来のソフトウェア開発とは異なる、これまでデータサイエンティストが取り組\nんできたようなアプローチ、つまるソフトウェア開発によるその場の問題解決が生成系\nAIを使うと可能になるので、新しいソフトウェアの応用方法として企業はしっかりと認\n知すべきだと思います。\n\nこういった世界ではソースコードを読む能力を持ったエンジニアはますます必要になっ\nてくるので、そういった意味でもRPAやノーコードに取り組んでいる企業は逆流している\nので気をつけたほうがよいと思います。\n\n",
